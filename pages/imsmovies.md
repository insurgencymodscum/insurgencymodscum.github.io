`The.Late.Bloomer.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Skiptrace.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Jackie Chan. 6 (Chinese) production companies (I counted!). Chinese *copy* of... some successful Hollywood movie.

`Mascots.2016.720p.WEBRip.X264-DEFLATE[rarbg]` Netflix attempt at a comedy.

`True.Memoirs.of.an.International.Assassin.2016.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-SHITBOX` Another Netflix - propaganda-with-product-placements - attempt at a movie.

`Dont.Think.Twice.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Goldstone.2016.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Australian.

`Army.of.One.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Nicolas Cage.

`The.Hollow.Point.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Patrick Wilson, John Leguizamo, Jim Belushi. If you gonna attempt a critique of firearms, you should know a little bit about guns first!

`Hot Girls Wanted (2015)` Netflix. Porn documentary. Never heard of "pro-am" ("professional-amateur", sigh...). Exec. producer: Abigail Disney.

`The Propaganda Game (2015)` Netflix. North Korea documentary. Annoying, unnecessary soundtrack.

`The  Armor of Light (2015)` Netflix. Another documentary by Abigail Disney. Nothing wrong, just not interesting enough.

`Collide.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS[rarbg]` Quit after 1 hour 20 minutes. Nicholas Hoult, Felicity Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley & product placements. Chinese production company logo.

`Burt's Buzz` Netflix. Documentary on Burt's Bees, a lip balm.

`A.Street.Cat.Named.Bob.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` British. Homelessness & drugs.

`Bad.Santa.2.2016.UNRATED.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]`

`XX.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror vignettes. Nothing wrong with this movie, just not interesting enough.

`Stratton.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Possibly used used the bullet ricochet sound from *Sergio-Leonne-era* westerns.

`Headshot.2016.INDONESIAN.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Stylized violence. Nothing wrong, just not my cup of tea.

`Always.Shine.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Shitty, artsy ending. Wasted potential. Too much hill climbing and not enough *lesbionics*. Director & writer go on the shitlist: Sophia Takal, Lawrence Michael Levine.

`Bokeh.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Skimmed through the rest after about 60 minutes. Too much product placement (looking at you Iceland!). IMDB: *"I have seen some interesting cinematic and literary iterations of the "wake up as the last person on Earth" plot structure, but this is first time I've seen it reincarnated as a tourism advertisement. The fact that this movie tries to pass itself off as some sort of existential art film is simply insulting."*

`Catfight.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Don't understand why people think Sandra Oh is anything but ugly!

`The.Eyes.of.My.Mother.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror. Black & white movie that is not `The Artist (2011)`? - deleted.

`All.Nighter.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` J.K. Simmons, Emile Hirsch.

`The.9th.Life.of.Louis.Drax.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Not good enough.

`Personal.Shopper.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-LOST` Kristen Stewart.

`Kill.Switch.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` *Half-Life*-like POV. Too many clichés. Dan Stevens (good actor BTW) is busy this year!

`Bottom.of.the.World.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Too artsy. Director: Richard Sears.

`Lo.and.Behold.Reveries.of.the.Connected.World.2016.DOCU.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Werner Herzog. Documentary about the Internet.

`War.Machine.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-SB` Netflix. Brad Pitt.

`Collateral.Beauty.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Will Smith. Sad. Nothing wrong, just not good enough.

`A.Bridge.Too.Far.1977.UNCUT.1080p.BluRay.x264-FSiHD` Action scenes are dated. This movie didn't age well IMHO.

`Logan.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Gritty superhero movie, but unlike Deadpool, full of the typical tropes and clichés.

`The.Hunters.Prayer.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Sam Worthington. Paint-by-numbers cookie-cutter Euro action.

`20th.Century.Women.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` First world problems. Shitlisted: writer & director: Mike Mills.

`2.22.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Skimmed through. Australian. Teresa Palmer. Writers: Todd Stein, Nathan Parker. Director: Paul Currie.

`The.Spymasters.CIA.in.the.Crosshairs.2015.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-monkee` *"Documentary"*. Showtime. You have access to all these politicians and you fuck it all up by filling your "documentary" with dramatic music, and other cheap tricks. Starts with videos of US forces being blown up. Skimmed through; seems to cover everything including 9/11. Instead of asking questions - like why the people responsible for 9/11 have been promoted instead of fired or imprisoned, this "documentary" wastes time on useless bullshit. Director: Gedeon Naudet, Jules Naudet. Writer: Chris Whipple.

`The.Vessel.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Hipster*ish*. IMDB: *Art house film that raises serious religious questions* "Serious religious questions"? - that's what books are for.  Writer-director: Julio Quintana.

`Mine.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264.DD5.1-FGT` Armie Hammer. IMDB: *How do you think people in conflict zones get most of their safety and behavioural programming? It's certainly not from the war mongering parties! In Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan and other war-torn nations, people are watching this sort of drivel and then hoping to use it to keep their children safe.* Spanish production. Writer-directors: Fabio Guaglione, Fabio Resinaro. Nobody is asking you to go full *Michael Mann*, but hire a fucking military & weapons consultant if you gonna make a war movie!

`The.Comedian.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Robert De Niro. Not good enough.

`Sleepless.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` IMDB: *...do you really want to spend your life watching so-so movies?...* *So if you're happy with low-bar movies, go watch it, but maybe you want to raise your expectations and, hope beyond hope, perhaps filmmaker will raise their game. But don't hold your breath.*

`The.Circle.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE` Netflix. IMDB: *Zero subtlety to the point where it's laughable, ruining any cautionary moral of the story that may have come from exploring the subject matter of overreaching technology*

`Una.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Pointless. `Rooney Mara`'s boobs: 00.03.49, 01.01.13, 01.08.01.

`Mindhorn.2017.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-FGT` British. Comedy. Not bad, just not good enough. Sad.

`The.Big.Sick.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` RomCom. `Zoe Kazan` (She was good in `Ruby Sparks (2012)`)

`The.Vault.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Three minutes 20 seconds of fucking logos! `James Franco`. Skimmed through. `Q'orianka Kilcher` is hot.

`Revolt.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS[rarbg]` B-movie-level script with A-movie-level SFX. If only they hired a military advisor (South Africa seems to have a lot of ex-SF people).

`47.Meters.Down.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` British sharks. 38!, THIRTY-EIGHT "producers" (I counted) and (I think) they show all of them in opening titles! Three minutes 20 seconds of fucking titles... Music by `Tomanddandy`. White girl booty that doesn't belong to Blake Lively?: skimmed through.

`The.Beguiled.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Shit (!!!) quality. 5:3 AR (1.66:1). Gave up after 20 minutes. `Colin Farrell` `Nicole Kidman` `Kirsten Dunst` `Elle Fanning`

`Killing.Gunther.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Arnold Schwarzenegger`

`Infinity.Chamber.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Regretted skimming though this. Low-budget dystopian almost-scifi. **TODO: REWATCH**

`The.Dark.Tower.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SHITBOX` Not... *alright, alright alright*. `Idris Elba`, `Matthew McConaughey`

`Cop.Watchers.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DDP.2.0.x264-TrollHD` BBC, shitty 40-minute documentary.

`Valerian.and.the.City.of.a.Thousand.Planets.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Chinese production money. Chinese pandering 30 (!) seconds in (1:30-1:50). Visually stunning, but it's just too much, too confusing. Not enough booty.

`Hangman.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Al Pacino`, `Karl Urban`, `Brittany Snow`. Crime.

`Bitch.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Interesting premise, bad execution.

`November.Criminals.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Chloe Grace Moretz`, `Ansel Elgort` & awkward teen sex. Crime, not the historic drama bout the *stab-in-the-back* myth in Nazi Germany.

`Wheelman.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-iNTENSO[rarbg]` Netflix. OK but not good enough.

`Lemon.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`24.Hours.to.Live.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Chinese money (read: pandering). Weak start, but gets better, but not good enough.

`Shortwave.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Skimmed through. Good part: 22 minutes in. Not sure if it's a very long music video, softcore porn or a horror movie. Tribute to/worship of `Juanita Ringeling`.

`Bright.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Netflix. `Will Smith`. Expected better from director `David Ayer`. Usual Hollywood firearm tropes.

`The.Killing.of.a.Sacred.Deer.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Colin Ferrell`, `Nicole Kidman`. Same movie as `The Lobster` (also with *Ferell*), same director & writers.

`Jungle.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-VETO[rarbg]` Survival. `Daniel Radcliffe`, `Joel Jackson` (`Deadline Gallipoli`). Conflict seemed forced. Director: `Greg McLean` (`Belko Experiment` which was good)

`Marshall.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Not good enough. **TODO: REWATCH?**

`The.Pirates.of.Somalia.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Quit after the usual *love interest* trope.

`Mother.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Quiet bad. See the IMDB-quotes blog post.

`Churchill.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-VETO[rarbg]` Weak script. Churchill autobiographer: *Modern clichés infest the screenplay, most of them cringe-making and profoundly unhistorical.*

`The.Snowman.2017.PROPER.720p.BluRay.x264-Replica[rarbg]` `Michael Fassbender`. Director: `Tomas Alfredson` (*Let the Right One In*, *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy*)

`Madame.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Harvey Keitel`. Script is not good enough.

`Little.Evil.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Netflix. Comedy.

`The.Strange.Ones.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Indie. Too artsy.

`Small.Town.Crime.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `John Hawkes`. Looks OK, but not good enough.

`Mom.and.Dad.2018.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Nicolas Cage`.

`Extortion.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Danny Glover`.

`Tragedy.Girls.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` 19-seconds-long (!!!) logo.

`Acts.Of.Vengeance.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Antonio Banderas`. Watch the first 3 minutes. No matter how hard you try, you are not gonna make Bulgaria into New York City. Production: *Saban Films*.

`You.Get.Me.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Netflix.

`Battle.of.the.Sexes.2017.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE[rarbg]` Biopic. Boring.

`Thumper.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Gritty crime. Not bad; skimmed through.

`The.Last.Face.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` **Bad!** Not usually a problem, but the *White Saviour* trope is strong in this one.

`Band.Aid.2017.LIMITED.1080p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Quit after 55 minutes, "comedy" turned into depressing drama.

`Dear.Dictator.2018.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Comedy? `Michael Caine`.

`Lady Bird (2017)` **Oscars2018**

`Wonder Wheel (2017)` Drama. `Woody Allen`. Essentially a play.

`The Strangers Prey at Night (2018)` Horror.

`Terminal (2018)`.

`Marwencool (2010)`. Documentary.

`Blockers (2018)`. Comedy. `Seth Rogen`.

`Blood.Fest.2018.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

*qqq*

# BAD #

`Special.Correspondents.2016.NF.720p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-PiA`

`Approaching.the.Unknown.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Terrible ending. Space suit at the end looked wrong. Run out of money?

`Blackway.2015.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Whiskey.Tango.Foxtrot.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-RARBG` This is not a *"comedy"*.

`600.Miles.2015.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Mexico's **Oscars2016** entry. You can tell by the lack of sights on the movie's poster it's shit. BTW this movie's editor should be fired - seconds-long shots of doorways?

`Equals.2015.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Watch Equilibrium instead!

`A.Hologram.for.the.King.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Tom Hanks.

`Money.Monster.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG`

`Edge.of.Winter.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Good photography, good acting, but something is missing.

`Bastille.Day.2016.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE[rarbg]`

`Morris.from.America.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Her name is Lina Keller, pervert!

`The.Land.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Central.Intelligence.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Should have listened to my gut. My first and last Kevin Hart movie.

`The.Neon.Demon.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Pretentious *"artsy"* drivel. The movie ends with "For Liv [heart symbol]". I wish the director also called this movie a *"a talkie"* at the beginning and save everyone who is not a *MacBook-wielding Starbucks-drinking* hipster two hours.

`Under.the.Sun.2015.DOCU.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Should have been a half hour Vice episode.

`Iliza.Shlesinger.Confirmed.Kills.2016.720p.WEBRip.x264.AAC2.0-FGT` Comedy special. Not funny.

`Yoga.Hosers.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Sequel to Tusk (2014). Kevin Smith.

`Nerve.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Ignore IMDB reviews. Unbearable soundtrack. Of course the usual Hollywood technical jargon is here but having a botnet vote to get network consensus and change code is very Bitcoin-like accurate! Pleasant surprise. Also accurate description of Silkroad-like Tor-hidden-service website and the dark web.

`Patient.Seven.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` OK if you fast forward through the boring parts. Do not miss the story with Alfie Allen ("Reek" from Game of Thrones)!

`Jason.Bourne.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Scanned through 7 pages of reviews by "Prolific" IMDB reviewers. People are fucking idiots. Exactly - shot for shot - the same movie as the last four. Some parts were written by a Las Vegas casino, Las Vegas Police (competent and timely response) and an armoured car manufacturer (Abrams-like "Bearcat").

`Mechanic.Resurrection.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT`

`Dust.To.Glory.2005.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Decent documentary, killed by annoying narration by director Dana Brown (did I say Dana Brown?), who loves himself & his name (did I mentioned this movie is directed by Dana Brown?) too much. Dana, the movie is not about you FFS!

`David.Brent.Life.on.the.Road.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Ricky Gervais.

`Denial.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Holocaust denial law. Too much Rachel Weisz, not enough law.

`Dog.Eat.Dog.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` One of the rare, it's-shit-but-you-can't-stop-watching movie. Nicolas Cage, Willem Dafoe.

`Jack.Reacher.Never.Go.Back.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` **OK** but compared to Jack Reacher, a huge disappointment. The standard Hollywood script & firearm tactics with extra bullet sparks! Chinese production companies. Director: Christopher McQuarrie, (Navy SEAL) technical advisor & brother: Doug McQuarrie. This ain't *The Way of the Gun* - their previous collaboration!

`12.Feet.Deep.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Writers are ignorant idiots. If you are a diabetic with LOW blood sugar (*hypoglicemic*) you need to RAISE your blood sugar by eating some carbohydrates. Writers: Matt Eskandari (also the director), Michael Hultquist.

`The.Mummy.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Boring.

`The.Lost.City.of.Z.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Message.from.the.King.2016.720p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Netflix. Teresa Palmer (sideboob-from-the-back). Bad writing full of clichés and tropes. Writers: Oliver Butcher, Stephen Cornwell. Director: Fabrice du Welz.

`Beatriz.at.Dinner.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Pointless. Director `Miguel Arteta` goes on the shitlist for claiming it's a "comedy", it is not! Also IMDB reviews full of RWAs. Only good thing is the soundtrack by Brian Eno (`Heat`).

`It.Comes.at.Night.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Pointless. Pretty average to good, apart from the plot, which is... *pointless*.

`The.Layover.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Kate Upton [too big(?)], Alexandra Daddario [ass too small(?)]. **Not enough boobs, thus pointless** Dresses: 29:45, boobs: 36:16, 37:50, "sex": 01:01:30. Skimmed through. Very bad. Daddario is a good actress, should fire her agent.

`Baby.Driver.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Supplied subs are OOS. Too much. Would have been average, but the ending became unbearable & director `Edgar Wright` goes on the shitlist for having `Lily James` and not shooting her... *assets* (see `Exception (2016)` for that). IMDB: 8.1 (120,000 / Sep 2017). You want heists: watch Heat. You want car chases: watch Taxi (the original French one).

`Oklahoma.City.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-Coo7` Documentary. PBS. Too long & preachy.

`The.Foreigner.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTb` Netflix normalizing torture, extra-judicial killing with the help of Chinese money.

`The.Cloverfield.Paradox.2018.720p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Netflix & `JJ Abrams`. Skim through for `Chris O'Dowd` parts. Should have quit after the blatant Chinese pandering in the first 10 minutes.

`Beast.of.Burden.2018.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Crime-drama. `Daniel Radcliffe`. Director: `Jesper Ganslandt`. *A Bastard Child of Locke (one guy in a vehicle) and American Made (smuggling).* (Also *Wheelman (2017)*).

`You Were Never Really Here (2017)` Drama. Amazon. `Joaquin Phoenix`. Technically good, but pointless.

`Molly's Game (2017)` **Oscars2018**

`Downsizing (2017)` Not a comedy. The one good quote: *American people, eight kind of fuck. Love fuck, hate fuck, sex-only fuck, break-up fuck, make-up fuck, drunk fuck, buddy fuck, pity fuck.*

`Submergence (2017)`. Romance-drama. Pointless. `Alicia Vikander` (sideboobs), `James McAvoy`.

`True Crimes (2016)` *AKA Dark Crimes*. (Polish) crime. Released in 2018.

`Rampage (2018)`.

*bbb*

# AVERAGE #

`The.Family.Fang.2015.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`Triple.9.2016.720p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Depressing. Lots of action but not as good as *Heat*.

`13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016)` Michael Bay.

`Hail.Caesar.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Coen brothers.

`The.Do.Over.2016.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-BTW` Netflix is not HBO, but this has Paula Patton.

`Eddie.The.Eagle.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-RARBG` Eye-lube with 80s music.

`Manhattan.Night.2016.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Depressing.

`Eye.in.the.Sky.2015.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Seems unrealistic. Basically same as *Good Kill (2014)*.

`Blue.Caprice.2013.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG`

`A.Bigger.Splash.2015.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Mixed feelings. Should be half an hour shorter IMHO.

`Green.Room.2015.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-RARBG` Directed by the guy who made *Blue Ruin (2013)*, one of top firearm "realism" movies ever.  Director also posts on IMDB forum. Worse than *Blue Ruin* IMHO.

`Elvis.and.Nixon.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Michael Shannon (Shannon on Trump: *"There's a lot of old people who need to realize they've had a nice life, and it's time for them to move on, because they're the ones who go out and vote for these assholes. If you look at the young people, between 18 and 25, if it was up to them, Hillary [Clinton] would have been president. No offense to the seniors out there. My mom's a senior citizen. But if you're voting for Trump, it's time for the urn."*)

`The.Nice.Guys.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG`

`PBS.POV.Armadillo.2010.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.Forum` Again distracting, overdone soundtrack. Rather than let the bullets cracking overhead do the talking (sorry), directors have to "Hollywood" it up and add distracting soundtrack. Of course 1,000,000 times better than `Hornet's Nest (2014)`, still the worst war documentary ever.

`Imperium.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Daniel Radcliffe and Nazis.

`Spaceman.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Baseball.

`Kung.Fury.2015.SHORT.1080p.WEBRip.x264.AAC2.0-FGT` Awesome 80s/retro-video-game soundtrack by `Mitch Murder`. Reminds me of music on `Vice Principals`.

`The.Neighbor.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Weak ending.

`The.Good.Neighbor.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Sad.

`The.Whole.Truth.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Keanu Reeves. Think 90s legal dramas. Set in Louisiana for tax purposes (?).

`Blackfish (2013)` Documentary.

`In.a.Valley.of.Violence.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Western (a real one - not a *Tarantino* one) with Ethan Hawke, John Travolta.

`The.Search.for.General.Tso.2014.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-monkee` Seventy minute documentary about *General Tso Chicken* (pronounced "Zuo").

`Dont.Breathe.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Some plot holes and continuation errors, but OK.

`The.War.Room.1993.DOCU.720p.BluRay.x264-PSYCHD` Documentary, Bill Clinton's 1993 presidential campaign.

`Sully.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` Helpful US Airways employees and American Red Cross logos felt like product placement.

`Snowden.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Hollywood still can't get "hacking" scenes right.

`Sugar.Mountain.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT`

`War.Dogs.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` False (ACOG is not a "thermal scope"?!) or gibberish text in overlay graphics.

`The.Autopsy.of.Jane.Doe.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror with realistic characters with common sense e.g. Brian Cox's *"let's get the fuck out of here"*. One common trope though: close (secure) the fucking door if you gonna talk for a while!

`A.Kind.of.Murder.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Neo-noir. Jessica Biel, Patrick Wilson. Not a lot of IMDB reviews.

`Inferno.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Dan Brown. Tom Hanks. **BEGIN SPOILERS!** The ending apparently differs from the book. **END SPOILERS!**

`The.Birth.of.a.Nation.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Just like SlashDot, IMDB reviews are overflowing with RWAs / racists.

`Pet.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror-thriller. *Ksenia Solo* is good, but *Juno Temple* would have been perfect.

`Little.Sister.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Not good, not really bad. Mediocre.

`Come.and.Find.Me.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad).

`The.Girl.on.the.Train.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Emily Blunt.

`An Honest Liar (2014)` Netflix. Documentary on The Amazing Randi, a magician & skeptic. Directors Tyler Measom & Justin Weinstein go on the shitlist due to shady ethics.

`Alone.in.Berlin.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` WWII German resistance.

`(Eddie: Strongman) (2015)` Netflix. Documentary on strongman Eddie Hall.

`Arrival.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS` Perhaps overrated.

`White.God.2014.1080p.BluRay.x264-NODLABS[rarbg]` Hungarians do not like dogs (?).

`Passengers.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Romance in space.

`War.on.Everyone.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` A bit schizophrenic 70s-buddy-cop homage. Alexander Skarsgard, Michael Pena.

`White.Girl.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Morgan Saylor (Homeland) & simulated blowjobs.

`Captain.Fantastic.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Viggo Mortensen. Disappointing, weak ending.

`Operation.Avalanche.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` *Vice*. Moon landing faux-documentary. Had potential, but failed at the end.

`Manchester.by.the.Sea.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Good, but overrated. Narcissistic director ("Director... Kenneth Lonergan", "Film by... Kenneth Lonergan").

`Live.by.Night.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Directed & starring Ben Affleck. Unremarkable, typical *Hollywood* gunfight. Not as good as `The Town`.

`Assassins.Creed.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Michael Fassbender. Surprisingly decent, for a movie based on a video game. Sixteen fucking minutes of end credits!

`Hands.of.Stone.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-DRONES` For the perverts: sex scene: 34.44-35.25, ass: 37.38-39.59, cameltoe: 01.26.08-1.28.16.

`Miss.Sloane.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS` Political lobbying regarding guns.

`Billy.Lynns.Long.Halftime.Walk.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-FGT` Chinese production company. Lots of POV shots. Some out-of-place meta references.

`Detour.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Surprisingly OK. Starts out weak, but gets stronger. Good soundtrack. UPDATE: Sountrack by *Toydrum* (`Prevenge (2016`).

`The.Discovery.2017.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-FGT` Netflix. Weak ending. Seems like they run out of money.

`Man.Down.2015.1080p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS` Shia LaBeouf. Depressing ending. Looking at the IMDB, surprisingly the idiots haven't yet found this movie and (usually incorrectly) goofed **ALL** the incorrect depictions of the military in this film.

`Prevenge.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror-drama-comedy. Pretty dark. Good soundtrack by *Toydrum* (associated with UNKLE).

`Voice.from.the.Stone.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Emilia Clarke (`Game of Thrones`), tits. A bit slow, but bearable.

`Aftermath.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Schwarzenegger. Drama. Agree with IMDB review, film doesn't achieve "closure". IMDB: *The film simply stops dead in its tracks and that's that. It felt cold and left me feeling slightly empty. Granted that is probably the intent of the filmmakers with a movie that deals with as dark a subject matter as this, but I felt it did it in an unsatisfying way.*

`Hidden.Figures.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Black women-"computers" at NASA.

`Small.Crimes.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-SB` Netflix. Finally something watchable from Netflix. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (`Game of Thrones`).

`The.Founder.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Michael Keaton. McDonalds.

`Life.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Horror in space. IMDB: *After the alien life-form attacks the scientist, there still seems to be no hurry to just shoot the lab into space. After all, it's just mankind's future that is at stake. No, the most important thing is to save the scientist. This crew would have benefited from a sociopath in their midst or a protocol obsessed captain. That would have saved them many times*

`Colossal.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-FGT` Anne Hathaway (she looks different because she's pregnant FYI), Jason Sudeikis.

`Weiner.2016.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-monkee` Documentary. Anthony Weiner. Sad. IMDB: *This film definitely falls into the category of "truth is stranger than fiction." It's hard to imagine another personality in recent history that is so unfiltered and self-absorbed in his quest for higher office, with the exception of a fellow named, Donald Trump.*

`The.Belko.Experiment.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-BLOW[rarbg]`

`Point.Break.2015.1080p.BluRay.x264-BLOW` Teresa Palmer.

`After.Porn.Ends.2.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Documentary. Yes, it's depressing.

`In.Order.of.Disappearance.2014.NORWEGiAN.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-FGT`

`Berlin.Syndrome.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Teresa Palmer. Here are the boobs, ass & *almost-pubic-mound* scenes perverts: 22, 30, 59, 1:02, 1:09, 1:26.

`Going.in.Style.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Remake.

`Sand.Castle.2017.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-FGT` Netflix. Distracting music during gunfights.

`Alien.Covenant.2017.INTERNAL.720p.BluRay.CRF.x264-SAPHiRE[rarbg]` AKA *EXACTLY What Not To Do In Space*. Buggy video, use VLC instead of MPC-BE. Nice *2001*-like classical soundtrack, ruined by "spaceship" sounds. **BEGIN SPOILERS** Plot hole (from IMDB):*8. The crew didn't know about Walter's self-healing capabilities? They should have and David stapling his facial wounds should have immediately tipped them off that this was David.* **END SPOILERS**

`The.Wall.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Amazon. Sniping.

`A.Cure.for.Wellness.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES` A *WTF*-type movie. **TODO: REWATCH?**

`The.Exception.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` WWII spying. One hell of a dinner invitation at 12.00! `Lily James` is great. Tits, ass & side-merkin for the perverts: 22.00, 58.05.

`Baywatch.2017.UNRATED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS` Watched for `Alexandra Daddario`. Surprisingly `Kelly Rohrbach` (blonde) was also decent. IMDB: *None of the jokes land, so you're actually laughing at the unintentionally funny moments, or just laughing from the sheer sadness because there's nothing else you can do, except stare in bewilderment.*

`The.Hatton.Garden.Job.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPOOKS[rarbg]`

`The.Ticket.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Dan Stevens`.

`The.Zookeepers.Wife.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` `Jessica Chaistain`'s boobs: 13.05.

`Kong.Skull.Island.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` Chinese production & token Chinese. Surprisingly decent.

`Wonder.Woman.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-STRiFE` Not enough ass.

`What.Happened.to.Monday.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Noomi Rapace. Egotistical director. Very slow, but gets interesting. Boobs: 1:17:06.

`Rememory.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264.AAC2.0-FGT` Peter Dinklage. SciFi.

`Bleed.for.This.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Boxing. Good soundtrack.

`The.Limehouse.Golem.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` British Victorian-London crime. Booty: 1:24. Confusing ending (!?).

`HHhH.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-ULSHD` Good soundtrack. Some good moments, but also lots of tropes & cliches. See: `Anthropoid (2016)`, the same comment there WRT to the ending applies here too.

`War.For.The.Planet.Of.The.Apes.2017.INTERNAL.720p.BluRay.CRF.x264-SAPHiRE[rarbg]` Another blockbuster with no money left for a military advisor... Flawless CGI.

`The.Babysitter.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Note: `The.Babysitter.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTG` had bad AR. Skimmed through.

`Last.Rampage.The.Escape.of.Gary.Tison.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Low-budget, but decent.

`Black.Sea.2014.1080p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS` Jude Law. Submarines.

`The.Trip.to.Spain.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Comedy. Food porn. Travel. Still pointless and - this time - less funny than the last one (`Trip to Italy` IIRC).

`American.Assassin.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Stupid. "Nuclear physicist watchlist"? SMH. IMDB: *This is Taken for the Trump era, refitted without the charm of that film or the presence of someone like Neeson to carry it off. Should be one star. The second is for the effects team, who pull off an entertaining explosion at one point. Lord knows, there was nothing else to excite.*

`Logan.Lucky.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` `Daniel Craig`, `Channing Tatum`, lots of other good actors. Fun heist movie. One scene should have been cut. Also one obvious plot hole.

`Betting.on.Zero.2016.1080p.WEB.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Documentary. Herbalife.

`American.Made.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Tom Cruise`, CIA & cocaine.

`Wind.River.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Could have been great. Ruined by one stupidly-written scene. Also some usual tropes. **BEGIN SPOILERS** IMDB: *...Also, Renner convinces the FBI agent that she wasn't just lucky to have survived. What he should have said was that she was an idiot and got the rest of her colleagues killed by not recognizing an obvious danger...* **END SPOILERS**

`Icarus.2017.720p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE[rarbg]` Documentary. Netflix. Doping & anti-doping. About an hour too long.

`Detroit.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]` *Schindler's List* in 1960's Detroit. Depressing.

`Crooked.House.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Agatha Christie, British murder-mystery.

`6.Below.Miracle.on.the.Mountain.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Very average, *subtly*-Christian movie. Director `Scott Waugh` was co-director of `Acts of Valour`. (Shot in *Barco Escape*: three screens with 2.39:1 AR, 7.17 AR in total)

`Geralds.Game.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTG` Netflix. One gory scene.

`Ingrid.Goes.West.2017.REPACK.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Painful to watch at times. Good soundtrack. Not a *comedy*. Booty: **TODO**, cameltoe (?): 01:06:47.

`The.Mountain.Between.Us.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES` Romance. Survival. Pretty bad. No chemistry between `Idris Elba` & `Kate Winslet`.

`Blade.Runner.2049.2017.PROPER.720p.BluRay.x264-BLOW[rarbg]` `Ryan Gosling`, `Ana de Armas` (boobs).

`It.2017.PROPER.720p.BluRay.X264-DEFLATE[rarbg]` Horror. `Stephen King`.

`Better.Watch.Out.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Comedy-horror. Strong female character, became the ususal damsel in distress, but strong finish.

`Mark.Felt.The.Man.Who.Brought.Down.the.White.House.2017.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Biopic. `Liam Neeson`. Lots of famous actors. `Tom Sizemore` is bad. Boobs: 1:29:55

`My.Cousin.Rachel.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS` Romance-drama. Bad start, but gets better. `Rachel WeISZ`.

`Last.Flag.Flying.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Comedy-drama. `Steve Carell`, `Bryan Cranston`, `Laurence Fishburne`. Good acting, but some parts are poorly written.

`Rules.Dont.Apply.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Rom-com-drama. Yes, that's `Donald Trump's` `Steven Mnuchin's` face, the producer of this film. Very punchable face. Low, underrated IMDB scores.

`Breathe.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES` Biopic. `Andrew Garfield`.

`Maze.2017.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE[rarbg]` British. Prisons. Pretty good.

`Borg.vs.McEnroe.2017.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE[rarbg]` Sports (tennis). `Shia LaBeouf`. WEB-DL version: no subs. BluRay: no subs, hardcoded subs for Swedish parts; director `Janus Metz` goes on the shitlist for this. Also no soundtrack. **TODO: DL OST**

`Tulip.Fever.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]` Historical romance-drama. `Alicia Vikander`, `Holliday Grainger`. Holliday: boobs: 8m30s. Alicia: sex: 31m, whitegirl booty & sideboob: 42m50s.

`Chuck.2016.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Good biopic. `Liev Schreiber`.

`1922.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-iNTENSO[rarbg]` Horror. Netflix. `Thomas Jane`.

`Mudbound.2017.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTG` Depressing. Netflix's **Oscars2018** bait. Too long.

`Only.the.Brave.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` AKA *Only the Cool Staches*. Bio-action-drama. Firefighting. Good, even though some parts just don't fit well (tropes, clichés).

`Suburbicon.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Crime-black-comedy. `Matt Damon`

`Jawbone.2017.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS[rarbg]` British, boxing, gritty. `Ray Winstone`.

`Thank.You.For.Your.Service.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Bio-war-drama. `Miles Teller` (*Bleed For This*).

`A.Futile.and.Stupid.Gesture.2018.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-SiGMA` Bio-comedy-drama. Netflix. Weak middle (drags too much), but redeems itself at the end.

`Rebel.in.the.Eye.2017.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` Biopic. `Nicholas Hoult`, `Kevin Spacey`.

`The.Wizard.of.Lies.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS[rarbg]` HBO. Madoff. `Robert de Niro`.

`Goodbye.Christopher.Robin.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Bio-drama. `DomHNaLL Gleeson`, `Margot Robbie`. Sweet.

`In.Dubious.Battle.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Historic-drama. `James Franco` (also directed), `Selen Gomez` (suprisingly good, boobs (brestfeeding)). Too long. Pointless(?).

`The.Florida.Project.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` **Oscars2018** `Willem Dafoe`.

`Please.Stand.By.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Feel-good drama. Not *comedy*. `Dakota Fanning`, `Alice Eve`.

`Stronger.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Biopic. Boston Marathon Bombing. OK but `Jake Gyllenhaal` is good.

`Crash.Pad.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` "Comedy" (actually *comedy about romance*). Weak script, but `DomHNaLL Gleeson` (Black Mirror).

`Norman.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Richard Gere`. Some bad scenes, predictable, film editor should be fired.

`Darkest.Hour.2017.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Biopic. `Gary Oldman`. Much better than *Churchill (2017)*.

`Loving.Vincent.2017.LIMITED.1080p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]` **Oscars2018**. Animation: paintings (1 painting every 2 frames) of actors. **TODO: ID INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC 1.20.57-1.22.45**

`The.Commuter.2018.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Action-thriller. `Liam Neeson`. *AKA* `Non-Stop (2014) (but on a train!)`

`Jumanji.Welcome.to.the.Jungle.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` Family-adventure-comedy. `Dwayne Johnson`, `Jack Black`. Fun. `Kevin Hart` is tolerable. Director: `Jake Kasdan`

`Murder.On.The.Orient.Express.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]`

`The.Death.of.Stalin.2017.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE[rarbg]`

`The.Disaster.Artist.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` `Seth Rogen` is tolerable.

`Come.Sunday.2018.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-CiELOS` Biopic-religion. Netflix. `Chiwetel Ejiofor`. Ending is a bit weak.

`10x10.2018.720p.AMZN.WEBRip.DDP5.1.x264-NTG`

`Annihilation.2018.1080p.NF.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTG` Netflix. Read a fucking book! IMDB: *As with Garland's previous offering, Ex Machina, it's all style and no substance; nothing that hasn't been done before, better.*

`The Post (2017)` **Oscars2018** Meh.

`12 Strong (2018)` Action-"history". Hemswroth is good given a weak script (`Ted Tally`, `Peter Craig`.)

`Tomb Raider (2018)` `Alicia Vikander`.

`Tigerland (2000)`. Vietnam war. `Colin Farrell`, `Clifton Collins Jr`, `Shea Whigham`, `Matt Gerald`, `Michael Shannon`, `Cole Hauser`.

`RocknRolla (2008)` British gangsters. Director: `Guy Ritchie`. `Gerald Butler`, `Tom Wilkinson`, `Mark Strong`, `Idris Elba`, `Tom Hardy`, `Toby Kebbel` (good!),

`Hostiles (2017)`. Western. Exaggerated recoils? Gunfights: 47m (ambush), 1.23m (night assault), 1.36m (rain fishfight), 1.56m (final confrontation). Gunfights not as good as `Open Range`?

`Father Figures (2017)`

`A Quiet Place`. Religious propaganda.

`My Friend Dahmer (2017)`. ~Biopic(?).

`United 93 (2006)`.

*aaa*

# GOOD #

`Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)`

`Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)`

`Pride and Prejudice and Zombies`

`The.Trust.2016.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` Nicolas Cage. Good movie, terrible predictable ending. Don't know why others call it a "unique twist", you can see it a mile away.

`The.Bronze.2015.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG`

`Traders.2015.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG` British. Almost no IMDB reviews, but surprisingly good.

`Tusk.2014.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS[rarbg]`

`Free.State.of.Jones.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Alright, alright, alright!

`Hunt.for.the.Wilderpeople.2016.1080p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE` *1080p RARBG torrent* is low quality. Mentions "Five Eyes" (NSA spying), accurate Stingray explanation. Cadbury Flake chocolate advert: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9X3IhfB7lk`

`Korengal.2014.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPLiTSViLLE` Follow up to `Restrepo (2010)`. Better than `Restrepo` IMHO.

`Anthropoid.2016.LIMITED.1080p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]` **BEGIN SPOILERS!** Assasination of Reinhard Heydrich. Good movie except: music during final gunfight, German tactics during final gunfight. Final gunfight was too *Hollywood* and not enough *Michael Mann*. I recall seeing a scene of resistance fighters fighting in the cellar, but can't recall the name of the movie. **END SPOILERS!** *UPDATE*: See `HHhH (2017)`.

`The.Handmaiden.2016.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi` From the director of Oldboy, **Some** (read: a satisfying amount of...) lesbionics.

`Hell.or.High.Water.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges. A bit like Michael Mann's Heat, but set in Texas. Possible plot holes, but the movie is good enough to forget them.

`The.Accountant.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS` Action. `Ben Affleck`. Some problems - `Anna Kendrick` is horribly miscast, realism issues e.g. "anti-aircraft rounds" - but they can be overlooked. **BEGIN SPOILERS!** From the director of Warrior (2011), so some father-son / brother-brother themes.**END SPOILERS!**

`The Thin Blue Line (1988)` Crime documentary. Also see `Documentary.Now.S01E04.The.Eye.Doesnt.Lie.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-BTN[rartv]`

`Hacksaw.Ridge.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Not perfect, perhaps battles are too Hollywood (e.g. no reloading).

`Trespass.Against.Us.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Michael Fassbender, Brendan Gleeson. Fathers-son theme.

`Nocturnal.Animals.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Either very *good* or very *shitty*. Michael Shannon. Unrelatable characters, **BEGIN SPOILERS!** poor writing in regards to firearm safety. **END SPOILERS!**

`Allied.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Brad Pitt, WWII, spying. Flawless?! **TODO: REWATCH WITH PROPER SUBS**

`The.Girl.with.All.the.Gifts.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-DRONES` An original zombie movie!

`Patriots.Day.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Boston Marathon. *Peter Berg's* best movie (`The Kingdom, Hancock, Battleship, Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, The Loosers (writer)`).

`Brimstone.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` *Schindler's-List*-level of depressing, although not without the usual firearm tropes (girl can not shoot guns AKA *Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy*, bullets defenestrating someone). Use *FORCED* subs for sign language parts.

`Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)` Forest Whitaker. Strange movie. Good soundtrack by RZA of Wu-Tang Clan. *"We're from different ancient tribes and now we're both almost extinct. But sometimes... you gotta stick with the ancient ways, the old-school ways"* sampled in the song "Gutted" by "Burial".

`Split.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Finally a good *M. Night ShYAmalan* movie. Chocolate booty: *Jessica Sula*.

`The.Cabin.in.the.Woods.2012.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-CtrlHD` Horror-comedy. Also see YouTube: "Every Reference in The Cabin in the Woods" by *GoodBadFlicks*.

`Gold.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Alright, alright, alright. Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramirez. *The Wolf of Wall Street: Gold Version*. **BEGIN SPOILERS!** The "Fool's Gold" reference is perfect! **END SPOILERS!**

`Get.Out.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Directed & written by `Jordan Peele` (of *Key & Peele*). Horror, black-comedy (no pun intended!). IMDB: *"My favourite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There's a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes; the characters aren't morons. I cringe every time I watch a genre film and the characters don't behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is amiss, enough to warrant wariness. Anyone in this situation would be unnerved as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally."* IMDB is full of reviews by RWAs.

`Their.Finest.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Romance-drama-war. `Gemma Arterton`, `Bill Nighy`, Perhaps a bit too long. Can not get any more British. A bit meta (movie within a movie; also see **The Cabin in the Woods**).

`T2.Trainspotting.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Director: `Danny Boyle`. **TODO: REWATCH** the BluRay version, since subs are fucked (`T2.Trainspotting.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-FGT`). Good soundtrack.

`Chips.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]` Motorcycles, `Isiah Whitlock Jr` (*"If you had been doing your job instead of looking at all this juicy, LA booty [IMS: in Lululemon yoga pants with "double-stitching on the side with a banana grundle ["It's the fucking gusset, bro. It's the gusset."]] they got out here, things wouldn't be so bad"*. OT: *zardoz-13* is a good IMDB reviewer, and of course fuck you to *"Greetings again from the darkness"* cretin).

`Black.Butterfly.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Thriller. `Antonio Banderas`, `Piper Perabo`. A bit meta. If you have `Piper Perabo` in your movie and do not shoot her... ehm... *assets*, you are an idiot.

`The.Dinner.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Drama. `Richard Gere`, `Steve Coogan`. Gets a bit slow in the middle, but pays well at the end. **TODO: REWATCH WITH PROPER SUBS**

`Ghost.in.the.Shell.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-STRiFE` `Scarlett Johansson`. Good gunfight scenes, but they used the same sound effect and foley sound library 99% of Hollywood movies use, resulting in a break of immersion. Major issue: `Scarlett Johansson`'s boobs jiggling sporadically (in one scene - they jiggle, in the next - they don't).

`Shot.Caller.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Action. `Nikolaj Coster-Waldau` (a bit skinny for a *con* IMHO) & a lot of great supporting actors (Jeffrey Donovan [Burn Notice], Jon Bernthal [The Walking Dead's Shane]). Director: Ric Roman Waugh. (Also directed Felon (2008), another really good prison movie with Stephen Dorff & an awesome performance by Val Kilmer). **BEGIN SPOILERS!** This starts out similarly to Felon, but grows into something like the French `A Prophet (2009)`. This is to *Felon* as Michael Mann's `Heat` is to `LA Takedown`. **END SPOILERS!**

`King.Arthur.Legend.of.the.Sword.2017.1080p.BluRay.x264-Replica[rarbg]` Strange movie. Way too much CGI, that you can tell cost millions of dollars. IMDB reviews are also strange, every other one mentions a *trailer*, are there *King Arthur* fanboys?

`Guardians.of.the.Galaxy.Vol.2.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Too much explosions but what made this superhero movie *good* instead of *average* is the Microsoft-product joke.

`6.Days.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Action: SAS, Iranian Embassy. Room clearing in 1980 is not as *sexy* as today (Armchair SAS'ing: should they stand in front of doors for so long long?). Director: `Toa Fraser`. Writer: `Glenn Standring`.

`Kim.Dotcom.Caught.In.the.Web.2017.DOCU.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-NOGRP` Documentary. Asshole "producer": Jonathan T. Taplin (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0850038/); last IMDB credit is in 1998. The end credits design is one of the most original this writer ever seen.

`John.Wick.Chapter.2.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` Action. Charging AR15 sound effect fail(?): 45:12; sound design fail (gunshots, music during gunfights). Awesome gunfights though apart from massive SOUND DESIGN FAIL!!! Suppressor fail(?): 1:17:55. Notice the automatic fire selection: 1:39:04, *Michael-Mann-esque* detail!

`All.Eyez.on.Me.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Tupac Shakur biopic.

`Busters.Mal.Heart.2016.LIMITED.1080p.BluRay.x264-ROVERS[rarbg]` Weird. `Rami Malek`. Unsatisfying ending.

`The.Little.Hours.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Quirky comedy. One burst-out-laughing moment thanks to `John C Riley`. `Kate Micucci` (of `Garfunkel and Oates`, *itty-bitty* titties & merkin at 1:06, `Aubrey Plaza` (*itty-bitty* titties, same scene).

`Brawl.in.Cell.Block.99.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Prison-exploitation. `Vince Vaughn`. 1.85 AR is good for 16:9 (1.77) screens. Movie goes full-retard ~36 minutes in. *THE MOST* ridiculous movie shootout ever! Good soundtrack. This is an *exploitaion* film. This author had the wrong expectations going into this movie. Future cult movie (?). Regretted skimming through. **TODO: REWATCH?**

`Atomic.Blonde.2017.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-HDC` Action. **TODO: REWATCH** Good soundtrack. Realism! (Chamber checks *every single time!*). Some of the *John Wick*-esque handgun handling seemed anachronistic. Lesbionics: 50:00. Brass checks, disarming & round chambering, awesome gun & hand-to-hand fight & car chase: 1:11:22+.

`Sweet.Virginia.2017.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` Drama. `Jon Bernthal` (The Walking Dead), `Imogen Poots`. `Christopher Abbott`, is good.  Depressing. Good soundtrack. **TODO: DL OST**

`Dunkirk.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` War. `Christopher Nolan`.

`I.Love.You.Daddy.2017.DVDScr.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8` B&W "comedy-drama" (actually not a comedy, sad). `Louis C.K.`, `Chloe Grace Moretz` (very good). Xvid version is as good as it gets for now.

`Kingsman.The.Golden.Circle.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS[rarbg]` Action. Can't decide if it's not as good as the first one, or just "fun". Also... *Vaginal Tracking*.

`The.Polka.King.2017.1080p.WEBRip.x264-STRiFE` Comedy-biopic.`Jack Black`, `Jason Schwartzman`. Netflix finally produces a *good* movie! Ignore the low IMDB score & bad reviews.

`Roman.J.Israel.Esq.2017.720p.BluRay.x264-DRONES[rarbg]` Legal drama. `Denzel Washington`, `Colin Farrell`. Good soundtrack. **TODO: DL OST**

`Mean.Dreams.2016.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT` `Bill Paxton`. End credits songs: 1.39.14-1.41.12: credits say it's `Alternate World (Alternate Age)`, but it's either instrumental version or a variation or remix, 1.41.08-: `Son Lux - Alternate World`. **TODO: DL OST**

`Brigsby.Bear.2017.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-MT` Comedy-drama. Director `Dave McCary` didn't mess up the *so-pathetic-it's-sad-not-funny* comedy-drama balance that ruins many movies.

`The.Outsider.2018.iNTERNAL.1080p.WEB.x264-STRiFE` Crime-drama. Netflix. `Jared Leto`. (Underrated: 20% on RT AO 2018-04) **TODO: DL OST**

`I Tonya (2017)` Biopic. **Oscars2018** `Margot Robbie`.

`The Shape of Water (2017)` Get proper subs for sign language AND(!) foreign parts! **Oscars2018**

`7 Days in Entebbe (2018)`. Promising start. Weak ending.

`Isle of Dogs (2018)`. `Wes Anderson`. Perhaps a bit too much `Wes Anderson`.
