INSMODSCUM comments:<br />
<ul><li>Awesome background music.</li>
<li>Gameplay looks nice.</li>
<li>FOV looks very good.</li>
<li>Tracers are too COD.</li>
<li>Sounds could be better. Supersonic cracks?</li>
<li>Recoil seems a bit low.</li>
<li>ROF seems a bit low.</li>
<li>Fucking slow as fuck PM reload. Insurgency 2 players will get the <i>same </i>lazy Insurgency Mod Insurgent or Marine.</li>
<li>Shotguns: INSMODSCUM feels nostalgic. NWI, go with the Insurgency Mod approach. Make shotguns by far the deadliest weapon, and when (inevitably)&nbsp;forum trolls start complaining, nerf them, so they go into oblivion to be used by noobs and people overly confident in their abilities.</li>
<li>Possible vehicles or aircraft?</li>
<li>Seems like NWI is gonna implement "normal" and "realism" modes. Hope they succeed because it is not easy, just look at TWI and their&nbsp;<a href="http://shuntyard.blogspot.com/">RO 2 debacle</a>.</li>

<blockquote>ABOUT<br />
Insurgency 2 is a primarily multiplayer FPS (First Person Shooter) with a gameplay style best characterized as <b>high speed tactical</b>. The game features quick action yet retains a strong emphasis on realism in its environments and gameplay. The game is a sequel to a popular free-to-play total conversion for Half-Life 2 entitled Insurgency. Featuring an ultra realistic style of play based on real world locations in an ongoing war in Iraq, it was downloaded a million times in the first week of launch alone.<br />
<br />
After most of the core team got picked up by top game studios or went on to receive degrees, many of us have come back together to develop Insurgency 2 and form New World Interactive. We’ve been listening to the community, playtesting daily and doing our best to make the game what we always wanted it to be - staying true to the game’s original flavor while expanding upon it.<br />
<br />
PRIMARY FEATURES<br />
POWERFUL WEAPONRY<br />
Weapons feel more powerful and behave more naturally than most games, a<b>nd we have many older yet effective WW2-era classics in the game for use as well</b>.<br />
<br />
TEAMWORK FOCUSED<br />
A new proximity indicator notifies you of nearby teammates, allowing players to more easily stick together in their approach to the objective. Teamwork is by no means required in the game, however players that do work with others will perform better.<br />
<br />
ADVANCED OUTFITTING<br />
Our new class and weapon cache systems no longer restrict loadouts to people like in the original game. Your options for classes are light, standard and heavy - whichever one you choose determines your speed, armor and ammo capacity. This is all independent of which weapon you want to use.<br />
<br />
WEAPON CACHES<br />
Players instantly respawn by their team’s weapon cache. Weapon caches are the new way of arming yourself. Every time you respawn you may choose a different weapon, depending on how you feel. Players can upgrade their weapons by performing objectives, and when they do so it actually upgrades that weapon for everyone on their team.<br />
<br />
"OCCUPY" GAME MODE<br />
In the new king of the hill inspired "Occupy" Game Mode, teams fight over control of the map’s central high ground.<br />
<br />
PERSONAL ITEMS<br />
<b>Players can collect and trade personal items in the game</b>. Sidearms, melee weapons and explosives are all items that players can collect over time in the game<b>.</b></blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" />Insurgency 2 info (<a href="http://www.newworldinteractive.com/index.php?page=games">http://www.newworldinteractive.com/index.php?page=games</a>):<br />

<br />
<blockquote>ABOUT THIS PROJECT<br />
<br />
Brief Intro<br />
<br />
My name is Jeremy Blum, and I'm the creative director at New World Interactive. About six years ago, me and a small team of mod aficionados created a free-to-play total conversion for Half-Life 2 entitled Insurgency. Featuring an ultra realistic style of play based on real world locations in an ongoing war in Iraq, Insurgency was a massive hit for our team. <br />
<br />
<br />
When it first launched, we were somewhat blown away by the response to the game, which at first was quite massive but over time settled into a much smaller and ultra-dedicated following that kept coming back - week after week, month after month. That same year, Insurgency was recognized as the "Player's Choice" Mod of the Year.<br />
<br />
As time grew, the outcry for an updated version with new content, upgraded visuals, enhanced weapons and new game modes continued to grow, however most of our core team got picked up by top game studios (Crytek, Blizzard, Digital Extremes and Gearbox to name a few) or went off to get a degree, leaving the mod in a creative state of disarray.<br />
<br />
Four years later much of the original core team came back together to develop Insurgency 2 and form New World Interactive. We've been listening to the community, playtesting daily and doing our best to make the game what we always wanted it to be.<br />
<br />
Where We're At<br />
<br />
<br />
We've been working on Insurgency 2 for some time now and it's coming along quite nicely. I like to think of the gameplay as a mix between Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and Day of Defeat, which are two of our all time personal favorites.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are asking how the game compares to the original Insurgency... Well, the code is based on Beta 1, so if you're familiar with how the game felt back then you shouldn't have a hard time getting into Insurgency 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
The main difference between the game and the mod has to do with the smaller scale and more linear nature of our maps, which was a design decision based on the technical specifications of the engine we're using.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why Kickstarter?<br />
<br />
We see Kickstarter as a great opportunity for all creative endeavors. It's been around for a little while now, but only recently has it become so popular that you can fund a video game project on it. Making a good video game is expensive! <br />
<br />
We feel that innovation is thriving here. With more and more projects popping up some feel Kickstarter is getting flooded, but we see it as growing and projects needing to adapt to a both larger and wiser fan base. <br />
<br />
<br />
Our situation is unique because we're not coming to you with an idea and some concept art. We're coming to you after almost a year of self-sustained development. We've already taken our game quite far along - figuring out what works and what doesn't. We know what we have to do to make this game as great as it can be.<br />
<br />
What We're Gonna Do With $180k<br />
<br />
From a gameplay and stability perspective our game feels really solid. Although this is imperative to the overall success of the game, a few months ago we made the conscious decision that if we're going to compete on an even higher level we need to rethink our art direction. <br />
<br />
<br />
If our campaign is successful, we will literally put every single dime into making the game look as good as it plays, and work towards shipping as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why Now?<br />
<br />
We're passionate enough about this project that even with minimal financial support we'd still find a way to get it done. There are, however, many challenges to working this way, and the timing of release would be in question.<br />
<br />
If we're successful, now, we'll be able to confidently deliver something we are proud of within a relatively quick time frame so you all can get your hands on this thing as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Why Should I Pledge?<br />
<br />
Because...<br />
<br />
you want to support a promising new game project<br />
you're a fan of the original and Insurgency living on is music to your ears<br />
you're friends or family of a developer and want to see us succeed<br />
you enjoy FPS games but you're getting tired of the same franchises over and over<br />
Stretch Goals<br />
<br />
We have a lot of friends in the industry who are highly talented and interested in working with us, but unfortunately their high salaries at top studios keep them there. If we surpass our goal we will be able to attract additional talent and make the game even more visually diverse and stunning. <br />
<br />
$200,000 | One extra map<br />
<br />
$300,000 | Two extra maps and four extra weapons<br />
<br />
$400,000 | Four extra maps and eight extra weapons<br />
<br />
$600,000 | Cooperative game mode<br />
<br />
$800,000 | Console version<br />
<br />
Console games are much more expensive to develop, so we would need a lot more money if we were to develop a console version for digital download. If we did this it would be after our initial launch on PC and Mac.<br />

About Insurgency<br />
<br />
Five years ago Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was first released as a mod for Half-Life 2. The main features of Insurgency were intense realism, objective based gameplay, a squad system with commanders that can give orders, and it featured the Iraq war which was still going on at the time and brought the mod a lot of attention. In the first week it received a million free downloads, and the very same year it won Mod of the Year. Five years later, you can still see people playing at any given time.<br />
