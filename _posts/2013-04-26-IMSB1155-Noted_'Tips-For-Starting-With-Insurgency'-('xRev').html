<br />
<b>Tip 1: Seek High Areas / Staircases</b><br />
<br />
From high areas, you can overwatch the situation. In Siege, there is a
 staircase at the beginning of the Security spawn. You can use this to 
enter a higher area which has a perfect overwatch on point B. Provide 
this overwatch to your teammates and capturing B will be basically 
peanuts.<br />
<br />
When executing this tip, you might want to look out for snipers lurking around.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip 2: Aim for the chest</b><br />
<br />
In Insurgency, I experience it best to shoot at the chest. Shooting 
in the head might be more effective, but is a lot harder and the 
efficiency lost in shooting on the chest isn't a lot. Two or three bullets to 
the chest will usually do the job with the M14. Take advantage of the 
fact that Insurgency takes weapon realism and lethality serious, and 
that a player isn't basically invincible when they shoot at the chest!<br />
<br />
<b>Tip 3: Help each other</b><br />
<br />
It is always important in games like these to help each other. Best 
way to do that is to keep microphone contact with each other. When 
approaching a capzone, you might want to call for cover if you don't 
already have it.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip 4: Take inroute building routes</b><br />
<br />
When approaching the capzone, you can get snapped by 
snipers lurking around the street. Best is to take the inroute building 
routes. Doing this will prevent sniper usage against you. Always keep 
your gun prepared when doing this though, because you can always come 
across CQB's in building routes. If this happens, you want to quickly 
squeeze the trigger.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip 5: Don't lone-wolf </b>[IMS: unless you really know what you are doing]<br />
<br />
Always try to get into a team. Walking alone in Insurgency, and 
you're basically a dead man walking. This tip is basically directly 
linked to 'Tip 3'.</blockquote>
