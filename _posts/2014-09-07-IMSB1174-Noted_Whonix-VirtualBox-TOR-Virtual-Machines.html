"Incognito Gateway 0.6.1" is actually older than "TOR Gateway 0.5.5"<br /><br />Whonix, the *only* currently updated TOR Virtual Machine is slowly becoming a bloated piece of shit.<br /><br />Again KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle is ignored. "Brogrammers" love change, for change's sake. If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it!<br /><br />Whonix Gateway 0.4.5 was 417 MB. Whonix Gateway 9.2 (fucking "brogrammers" can't count) is 1,546 MB.
