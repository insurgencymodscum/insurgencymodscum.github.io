<b>Insurgency Coming Soon on Steam
</b><br />
<br />

<blockquote>
Insurgency will soon be available on the early access section of Steam. We've had to do a lot of thinking about our pricing strategy over the long term. We believe this game will be worth $19.99 or $24.99 when we do our full release, and the success and duration of our upcoming early access on Steam will determine this. For the time being however, we have decided to lower the price point of the game to $14.99 for our upcoming early access on Steam.<br />
<br />
At New World Interactive it’s incredibly valuable for us to be honest and loyal and as forthright as we can with our community. You are our lifeblood, and we genuinely appreciate all of the early support, feedback, and attention you have provided us. Because of you, we are in business and creating what we believe will be a revolutionary FPS experience with a long life ahead of it.<br />
<br />
We are lowering the price point because we want to open our game to a broader audience and bring more players into the servers, and ultimately create a bigger, stronger, more robust player community. We believe the price point drop will enable us to attract more players to Insurgency, which means more people on the servers and better matches for you all to regularly play in.<br />
<br />
Don’t think for a second we have forgotten about you. You got this thing started, and helped us craft the game over the past month and a half to be a much better, more realistic experience. You have set us on a new course, which our updates over the months ahead will reflect.<br />
<br />
Due to the price drop on Steam, we would like to reward our early purchasers with a gift, a personal thank you to signify and recognize your support. First, we would like to present you all with the credits in the game in our final release, recognizing you as a contributor. Second, NWI will provide you with a specialized Insurgency badge that signifies your early support, which will show on your Steam profile. And third, NWI will provide you with an extra Early Access key. That means you can give your friend/teacher/brother/comrade in arms a free code to play along with you (which actually doubles the value of your original buy-in).<br />
<br />
We hope you will enjoy these gifts as a token of appreciation for your loyal support and contribution to the development of Insurgency. We look forward to continue building this game and community together.<br />

TLDR: Insurgency2, Steam Early Access, <b>two </b>keys for $15. Dates unknown.<br />

Hate this marketing "coming soon" bullshit. You are not pushing crack cocaine New World Interactive and we are not Insurgency fiends... except maybe <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/cam61">Sham</a>.<br />

BTW is it "Insurgency 2" or "Insurgency2"? IMHO "Insurgency2" is probably better.<br />
