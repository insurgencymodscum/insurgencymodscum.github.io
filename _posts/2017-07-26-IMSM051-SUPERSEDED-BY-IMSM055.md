    Some thoughts:

    1. I wish AdBlock developers stop dumbing down the user interface of their extensions. I just want a box to enter URLs. Developers, keep it simple, stupid. And always show the URL of the list.

    2. Regarding MicroBlock. Here's a better way to organize lists.

        Ads

        EasyList
        EasyPrivacy
        Fanboy Ultimate List [what it includes here]

        Malware
        [malware domains lists here]

        Hosts
        [all hosts based lists here]

        Languages
        [all regional lists here listed by country)

        Anti Anti Adblock or Counter Countermeasure
        [developers should rename stupid looking titles such as "Anti-Adblock Killer | Reek" into something a little less stupid]
