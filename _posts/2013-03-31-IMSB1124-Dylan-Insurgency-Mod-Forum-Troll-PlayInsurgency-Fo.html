Dylan <br />Posted 04 March 2013 - 11:06 PM <br />Junior Member<br /><br />Members <br />53 posts <br /><br />I'm Dylan, I've been involved in INS since mid-late 2008. I was pretty active in the game, and used to be in -[TDB]- (24/7 Sinjar most of the time). I did some weapon tweaking mods for INS1 in its final days, and I'm looking forward to playing INS2 as much as I can.<br /><br />(I'll try not to be as annoying as I was on the old forums.)</blockquote>
