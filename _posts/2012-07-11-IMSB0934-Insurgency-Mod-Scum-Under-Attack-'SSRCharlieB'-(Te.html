I haven't checked recently to find out of you still live there. Easy enough to do, and I will, if you don't edit this Blog, leave it blank, at least as far as me and mine are concerne, and disappear from my life forever.<br />
<br />
Shall I publish the rest of your info in a couple of thousand places? like all the Forums you have been a Member of, and been banned from, for the last ten years or so? You have left an impressive array of enemies in your wake, more than enough to do to you all that you deserve, if I choose to let them know where you are.<br />
<br />
Should I?<br />
<br />
The "ball" is in your court, <b>and for future reference, if anything "untoward" happens, anything at all, if my house gets struck by lightninig, for instance, I WILL come for you.</b><br />
<br />
After I have toyed with you for a while first.<br />
<br />
I have fired a "warning shot" for your edification, just to get your attention, you understand? You should be hearing from it soon. If you edit this post and remove the offending material, it will end there. If not ... well ... <br />
<br />
I advise you to "Edit" ASAP. It is your only chance at living out the rest of your miserable life with any sort of normalcy. I will destroy your so-called life. You can be utterly certain of it.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />
<br />

<b>Went to see a Private Detective today. Gave him a $250 dollar retainer to find you with another $250 when he does.</b><br />
<br />
If he has no results, I will pay my lawyer to subpoena your records at your Blog, Facebook, etc. Wherever you are, I will either have friends there, or you will have enemies there. As for the "enemies", someone like you has a gazillion or so.<br />
<br />
Your @$$ is mine.<br />

$500 REWARD for Insurgency Mod Scum. Not bad IMHO...<br />

In case you haven't figured it out, you have p!$$ed me off you nothing little insect. <b>No matter how annonymous you think you are, you can be found</b>. If I'm wrong about who you are, it doesn't matter, I am going to find out. I am pretty much retired now. I have plenty of time on my hands to devote to this. I have enough money to pay whoever I need to to find you. <br />
<br />
<b>If I choose to go the legal route, I will contact all of your present and former "victims" and we will see you jailed for Criminal Libel. If you get a GOOD lawyer, you might be out in five years or so.</b> If I don't go legal, then only God will be able to help you. <b>I am a US Army Intelligence Vietnam Veteran, with a body count in three figures</b>, and with what they taught me, well... think about it. It was the real deal. No punk-ass game.<br />
<br />
I am going to make the pursuit of you, and retribution for your actions the next phase of my life's work. <br />
<br />
H#!!, I'm not working at the moment. I have lots of time and certainly nothing better or more enjoyable to do than to take you out of circulation.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to meeting you face-to-face.<br />

These guys HATE you, you tool !!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Here is a copy of an email from New World Interactive about you ...<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
New World Interactive sent you a message about Insurgency Mod Scum. <br />

I can assure you this guy is no affiliate. Would be happy if blogspot.com pulled the plug on him, but apparently it's through Google now and they have a really tedious way of reporting people like this. If you have any ideas about ways to take him down, we're all for it. He's been trying to damage our reputation for a while now and it seems he also slanders individuals as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
There is other stuff that is much worse, but I promised that I wouldn't share anything from our private correspondence.<br />
<br />
But they definitely don't like you, and like so many others, they want you gone.<br />
<br />
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! <br />
<br />
Are we having fun yet ???????<br />
<br />
As always...<br />
<br />
Good luck in prison ...<br />

I just thought it should be published here as well.<br />
