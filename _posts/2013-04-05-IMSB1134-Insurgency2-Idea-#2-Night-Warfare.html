<i>Just spitballing here, it's not all going to be gold.</i><br />
<br />
Simple. Security Forces get night vision equipment.<br />
<br />
Insurgents get flashlights. Some insurgents (those with highest scores) get flashlights with shitty batteries that they have to change.&nbsp; Insurgents with low scores get no batteries (simulating they just forget them at home) and have to check the map and return to the spawn point and pick them up.<br />
<br />
This might turn out to be too one-sided though, so this is still work in progress.<br />
<br />
P.S. This will promote communication, so this idea definitely has potential.
