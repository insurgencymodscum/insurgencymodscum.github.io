<blockquote>Piracy is the "opium of the people". Six months later in the summer there will be pain in Washington and on Wall Street. End copyright "theft" and the threshold for disgruntled folk to riot and cause social unrest will be much lower. Piracy may or may not cost entertainment industry profits but it is very effective in keeping people off the streets with films, music porn and games. Take that piracy-opium away and bored folk will vent energy that they are not doing at present against the super-rich, austerity, and welfare cut backs. <br />
<br />
So a prediction. The "cyberlocker" culling will result in massive social disturbance this summer. Worse, since the Euro is battling for survival, this will tip it into break up that in turn results in a worldwide financial panic.</blockquote>
