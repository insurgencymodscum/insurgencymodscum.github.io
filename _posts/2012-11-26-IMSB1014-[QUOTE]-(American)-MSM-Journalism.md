~~~
Nobody wants to read insightful, factual stories about actual things.

No, it's like pop music. The demographic that is most profitable is idiots, therefore most of the industry is geared to compete for that idiot demographic.

With music, most of the people buying has been tweens and teenagers who have nothing better to do with their time and listen to whatever shit their friends are listening too. It's convenient to the music industry too, because bands and singers which are nothing more than a face and a good producer are cheaper: you can make the next one hit wonder and pay them nothing. Musicians who you would describe as real artists with talent, they usually aren't willing to whore themselves out for temporary fame and a really small paycheck.

With news geared towards the masses, it has been discovered that people who tune in every night and spend money on whatever they see the ads for, those people dislike challenging journalism, they like stories that confirm their own beliefs and what they think is true. They like simple moral outrage, which is easier and cheaper to do than real journalism anyway. They can make a better profit by going after those people, so they do.
