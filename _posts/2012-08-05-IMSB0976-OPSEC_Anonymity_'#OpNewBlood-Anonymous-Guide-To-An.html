Okay, We need to talk.<br />
<br />
I know you don't know me and I've no idea who I'm talking to right now.<br />
<br />
Anonymous as it should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, a lot of new people ('newfags' &lt; if you take this offensive, stop that from now on) don't seem to know how this works.<br />
<br />
I don't want you to be(come) one of them, so I'll teach you a few things.<br />
<br />
<br />
This might get long, and maybe difficult &amp; not fun, but if you ain't willing to change the way you act/think, well.., You can stop reading right about now and I'll see you in court. On Tv...<br />
<br />
#############################################################################<br />
<br />
Still here?<br />
<br />
Good.<br />
<br />
I knew you wouldn't be so stupid to just leave.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right.<br />
<br />
First things first.<br />
<br />
<br />
This will be a two part system on making you 'anonymous' with minor tech related issues.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because most of it can be done in the mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Part one will be about 'dedox', the second on the actual mind changing bit.<br />
<br />
You do need to follow both actions for this to have any effect.<br />
<br />
#############################################################################<br />
<br />
Dedox.<br />
<br />
This is the easy part.<br />
<br />
You might be wondering, 'Hurr, dedox? You mean detox..?'<br />
<br />
You're partially right.<br />
and yet you ain't<br />
<br />
Let me explain.<br />
<br />
In this online world, personal details are called 'd0x' which is basically some lame 1337-term for documents.. (don't ask..)<br />
<br />
Now I expect that you already know what detox means.<br />
If you don't know, start Google (you'll need it later on anyway)<br />
<br />
Right, I think you roughly know what detox means now. (If you still don't, it's some way to get all the bad stuff out of your body)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now combine detox with d0x..<br />
Good, I see you sort of understand where I'm going to.<br />
<br />
Now go to Google.<br />
What I want you to do, is to search someone.<br />
..<br />
Search yourself.<br />
This sounds odd I know but trust me, you'll learn from this.<br />
<br />
What I want you to search are the following things:<br />
<br />
Everything<br />
Related<br />
to<br />
yourself.<br />
<br />
(Previous/old) usernames, emails, your own name, the place where you live, your phone number, your mobile number, any other thing that relates to you.<br />
<br />
I can make a long story out of this, but I won't because a lot of it is on &gt; http://school0fanon.tumblr.com/post/27490137702/anonymous-d0x-yourself-publicly-now-all-of-you &lt; already.<br />
<br />
Don't do it publicly though, as the title suggests.<br />
<br />
Just keep this to yourself.<br />
Hint: both search like *name* and *"name"* (remove stars)<br />
And watch out with sites you don't trust.<br />
<br />
Okay now you know what's on the internet because of you and about you (Rule #2, If you don't put something online, your friends love to do it for you, bastards..)<br />
<br />
As the article says, change/delete anything you find which you don't actually need.<br />
<br />
Old forum accounts with some personal details are a true treasure to d0xers (and the other, less nice kind of people, the ones with the badges)<br />
<br />
Take a piece of paper and write down EVERYTHING you find.<br />
You'll needs this later on.<br />
<br />
Once you've noted everything, try to delete/remove/change everything you don't need.<br />
<br />
Unsubscribe from mailing-lists, change password &amp; email into something useless if possible. Remove ANY personal data. including possible posts.<br />
<br />
Okay once you changed what's possible (remember, you can always mail the admins of sites to request the deletion of accounts) you're pretty much done for this part.<br />
<br />
Just be really, really sure.<br />
Doing it again won't be too bad.<br />
<br />
Now that this is set, it might be useful to start to check programs on updates.<br />
<br />
(Hackers abuse soft-/hardware that ain't updated)<br />
<br />
My personal advice would be the Secunia PSI, but you can do it manually too (takes a lot of time though + the PSI is free, so why not?)<br />
<br />
You'll probably see some stuff that you wouldn't have expected.<br />
Doesn't matter, some *ware just doesn't tell you when it's updated..<br />
Try to update as much as possible.<br />
(Remember, every detail counts and hackers really do try ANYTHING to hack you)<br />
<br />
I would also advice you to check for viruses and all that while you're at it.<br />
Note: if you've already downloaded 'hacker tools' secure these now or expect to download/install them again..<br />
<br />
What I would recommend is to do a scan with HitmanPro first (after all, it's free) and do a second scan with the Sophos VRT (Virus removal tool) afterwards.<br />
<br />
You should be up-to-date, safe and secure now.<br />
<br />
Ready to go the the next part? Because this was only the easy part...<br />
<br />
#############################################################################<br />
<br />
"The mind thing"<br />
<br />
This is basically the hardest part, yet the one that makes the most sense.<br />
<br />
Your online you won't be you.<br />
Keep this in mind.<br />
As an Anon, you won't be yourself.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean you can't state the things you think.<br />
It means that you won't be you, to the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
Remember that info you wrote down about yourself earlier on?<br />
You can't use or link to ANY of that.<br />
<br />
Lol no really, you can't.<br />
<br />
All these things track back to you.<br />
Online &amp; offline.<br />
<br />
And once things are linked, you're screwed..<br />
<br />
First read<br />
<br />
http://www.cyberguerrilla.org/?p=3322&amp;page=2 &amp;<br />
http://www.cyberguerrilla.org/?p=3322&amp;page=3<br />
<br />
if you don't know how to work with TOR yet.<br />
<br />
Start TOR.<br />
<br />
Now let's start with a new email.<br />
Yes, new.<br />
<br />
You can pick basically any email client you want, but you can also go for the more secure &amp; anonymous ones like hushmail.<br />
<br />
Setup for a rather secure &amp; anonymous email:<br />
<br />
Create it like this "username@mail.domain"<br />
<br />
Remember, this can't be one you already made once.<br />
This includes with the username, and make sure it doesn't links to anything on the paper. (if in doubt, check it, search it, research)<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure the password ain't related to anything either.<br />
if you can't think of anything, take the closest book.<br />
pick 4 random pages and use the first 3-4 characters of every 20th word on the page.<br />
<br />
(It might be useful to note this down somewhere secure.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Use the same method for the 'secret answer' , but a different outcome.<br />
<br />
Basically, make yourself some sort of weird cryptic thing that only YOU know.<br />
<br />
So I prefer it if you don't use the above method, but if you have at least 40 books with a lot of pages, it's worth a shot..<br />
<br />
You don't need to use books, just find your own special 'secret code'<br />
<br />
Now that you've got a email ( don't fill in any personal details please..)<br />
you can continue with the rest.<br />
<br />
Just remember this;<br />
<br />
Always keep it on 1 email an account.<br />
Always use your method for passwords and secret/safety questions.<br />
Always use/register Anon related things with TOR.<br />
<br />
#############################################################################<br />
<br />
Now the hardest thing for most people is the final step.<br />
<br />
Not being you.<br />
<br />
This is basically really simple, but people tend to forget it and f*ck up, get jailed etc.<br />
<br />
Don't share pictures online with metadata/exifdate still in them.<br />
(If you don't know what this is or how to remove it, search it with google on TOR)<br />
Don't share geolocations with tweets.<br />
Don't use real names of people.<br />
Don't share personal details to anyone.<br />
Don't speak to people you know in real life.<br />
Avoid links.<br />
Always keep the above in mind.<br />
<br />
#############################################################################<br />
<br />
Just be anonymous from now on, because if you use this (in combination with the rest of the www.cyberguerrilla.org guide) and you still get caught then well.<br />
<br />
See you in court. On Tv..<br />
..<br />
..<br />
..<br />
And maybe on the day we get you out.<br />
