<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Ayn Rand died in penniless poverty while dependent on the state to provide basic income ("Social Security") and medical care ("Medicare") that are necessary to maintain her life, all while maintaining that such a system is inherently evil. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.</blockquote>
