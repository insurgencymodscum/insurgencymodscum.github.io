Where is the proof to all these allegations of hax? I see many people labeled as hackers here, including myself (Ben Harrell). I love this game and I don't like cheaters either, but you show no proof of anyone cheating. In my opinion you just run a blog that simply targets any player you please. I don't even know who makes these accusations since there is never a name given. It's not very mature or professional to give good players a bad name just because you "think" they cheat. <b>In no way am I defending anyone listed on here</b> except myself since I do not spec people and take demos of them. I just hope you could atleast upload the demos so we could see who is actually cheating (especially mine).<br />
