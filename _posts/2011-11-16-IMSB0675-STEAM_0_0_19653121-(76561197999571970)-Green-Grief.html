Age: 20 (21 Dec 22)<br />
Name on Ventrilo: Green-.-<br />
Name on the forums: Green-.-<br />
Name in-Game on Servers: Green-.-<br />
Note: ĈĶGreen-.- is a DOD:S clan i have been in for 4 years about now. I was wondering if it were possible for me to be able to stay in this clan but be in MN at the same time. I asked about it but they were not sure. Was hoping it would work<br />
What Timezone are you in? Central Time <br />
What time of day do you play? Morning, Day, Night. When I can and weekends.<br />
What servers do you play on? |MN|,||NADES||,-|TDB|-,=LIGS=,[FR]<br />
Have you ever been banned on our Servers? no<br />
If so why? but i have spammed before but I'm chilled now wont do anything like that again. It was just dumb nonsense. Mostly what i remember is i was testing my music for HLSS and figured out it didn't work at all.<br />
How did you find out about us? i re downloaded insurgency to play it again. found MN server. played on it ever since.<br />
Who referred you to our clan (If anyone): CUTTHROATLOGIC<br />
Why should we pick you above all others? Well I'm a nice guy. I enjoy the MN server and people who play on it. I am sure i would be a nice new member to the clan. I try to be awesome and cool as i possibly can with people. I don't like being mean to people either, I'm usually the one they are mean to. An i like to just have good conversations while playing the game with people i meet</blockquote><br />
