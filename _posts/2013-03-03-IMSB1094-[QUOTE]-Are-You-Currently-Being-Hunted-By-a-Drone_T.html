With regards points 5 &amp; 6 and primitive jamming equipment it can be inordanetly effective.<br />
<br />
Essentially an electrical spark or arc contains a very broad band of frequencies at just about whatever power you would like.<br />
<br />
For instance take a DC motor (12V) and use it to drive a modified car distributor this will produce a quite useful set of pulses especially if you know a little bit about how to use an auto transformer to up the spark gap voltage. <br />
<br />
If fed into an appropriate "long wire" antenna this can jam out MW radios and HF radios over several square miles (I've tried it in the past and know it works ;)<br />
<br />
Now the problem with such a system is it's mainly low frequency interference not UHF and microwave.<br />
<br />
However there is a way to do this with a "top hat spark gap" the Victorians were known to have produced kilowatts of microwave power with such systems [1].<br />
<br />
The basic design is a sphere shaped electrode in a tube which is sealed at one end and has a plate at the other (it looks like a top hat) if you get the measurements correct such a system will generate some rather useful very broadband energy in the UHF and microwave bands.<br />
<br />
Such a system could be put together very simply and easily from cooking oil or auto oil drums and any metal plate from old vehicles etc.<br />
