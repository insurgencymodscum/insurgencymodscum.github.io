IMS2 with thousands of hours of Insurgency experience thinks you are hacking. That's why your STEAMID is posted here. There won't ever be any proof/demos/screenshots posted.<br />
<br />
Just like with almost EVERY other STEAMID (except myg0t and such) posted on this blog, <b>it is up to server admins to police their servers</b>.<br />
<br />
A competent server admin would always have a demo/proof before banning. An even better admin would have 3-strikes against you, i.e. 3 demos/suspect kills before banning.<br />
<br />
Also note that probably about half of cheaters posted on this blog are not banned. They either have friends who are admins and who are incompetent and allow the cheating or griefing to go on, or they are colluding with the cheater or griefer and knowingly allowing cheating and griefing to continue. Some of the cheaters and griefers are even admins themselves.<br />
<br />
Some examples.<br />
<br />
MurderNetworks, originally called 187ci, they sold cheats and hacks before renaming themselves. Same people run things and they had a lot of cheating or griefing members, some of them, admins.<br />
<br />
A few got banned, most didn't. Look at "CUTTHROATLOGIC" and his <i>reign of terror</i>.<br />
<br />
TAC, Trans Atlantic Community. Generally well-managed, but they had a few admins who were hacking. Look at "Logistics". See: <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/05/tac-scum-with-admin-rights.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/05/tac-scum-with-admin-rights.html</a><br />
<br />
Also look at BREJIFUS, mentioned in your comment, she is not cheating but she is a terrible admin and is probably colluding with a lot of cheaters and griefers. See: <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2013/03/rip-brejifus-i-int3ns3-battle-grounds.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2013/03/rip-brejifus-i-int3ns3-battle-grounds.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>If </b><i>BREJIFUS</i> banned you, then you probably <i>are</i> legit, because BREJIFUS is probably one of the worst admins in Insurgency, and she <i>only</i> started in 2011, one year after everybody else stopped playing. She wouldn't be able to spot a hack even if it was staring right in her <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2013/04/insurgency-mod-og-veteran-expert.html">fucking face</a>.
<br />
<br />
<b>TLDR: if you are not myg0t and banned <i>without </i>a proper demo, find a new server and email us the admin who banned you. The STEAMID of that admin will be posted here. If your STEAMID is posted here and then you are banned from a good server, that means there's (hopefully) at least two demos of you, and you ARE just <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/kamk/screenshots/">TOO FUCKING GOOD</a>. Find a new server.</b></blockquote>
