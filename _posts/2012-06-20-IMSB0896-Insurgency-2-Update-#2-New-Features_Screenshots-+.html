<br />
<blockquote>POWERED BY PORTAL 2<br />
We are building off a straight port of Insurgency Beta 1 to the latest version of Source Engine, powered by Portal 2. There have been many networking, physics, lighting, and other various technical improvements to the previous version of the engine<br />
<br />
POWERFUL WEAPONRY<br />
Weapons feel a lot more powerful than in most games, <b>and we have many older yet effective WW2-era classics in the game for use as well </b><span style="color: red;">[why?]</span><br />
<br />
TEAMWORK FOCUSED<br />
<b>A new proximity indicator</b> notifies you of nearby teammates, allowing players to more <b>easily stick together </b><span style="color: red;">[RPG whores: fuck yeah!!!]</span>. Teamwork is by no means required in the game, however players that do work with others will tend to get the better results<br />
<br />
"PUSH" IS BACK<br />
We have kept the "Push" game mode but made it only 2 objectives instead of 4, <b>so the maps are smaller and the rounds quicker </b><span style="color: red;">[Call Of Duty on Source Engine? <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_982w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/01/28/Magazine/Advance/Images/thewire-claydavisnew.jpg">shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</a>]</span>. <b>Teams swap after the round is over so attackers become defenders and defenders attackers&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
NEW ENVIRONMENT DIVERSITY<br />
The game has lost much of its former generic look by introducing new scenarios in addition to Iraq including <b>mountains in Afghanistan</b>, <b>war-torn Chechnya</b>, the pirate coast of <b>Somalia </b>and the recent Civil War in <b>Libya</b><br />
<br />
NEW "OCCUPY" GAME MODE<br />
In the new king of the hill inspired "Occupy" Game Mode, <b>teams fight over control of the map's central high ground</b>. Maps for this game mode are generally quite small in size and rounds can be quite intense toward the final seconds<br />
<br />
NEW GORE FEATURES<br />
Bullets, explosions and shrapnel will effect players much more than in the past - body dismemberment and other fancy gore features will be supported just to give players that much more visual feedback on their kills<br />
<br />
NEW LOADOUT SYSTEM<br />
Our new class and weapon cache systems no longer restrict loadouts to people like in the original game. <b>Your options for classes are light, standard and heavy</b> - whichever one you choose determines your speed, <b>armor </b>and ammo capacity. This is all independent of which weapon you want to use.<br />
<br />
NEW WEAPON CACHE SYSTEM<br />
Players instantly respawn by their team's weapon cache. Weapon caches are the new way of arming yourself. Every time you respawn you may choose a different weapon, depending on how you feel. <b>Players can upgrade their weapons by performing objectives, and when they do so it actually upgrades that weapon for everyone on their team</b><br />
<br />
PERSONAL ITEMS<br />
Players can collect and trade personal items in the game. Sidearms, melee weapons and explosives are all items that players can collect over time in the game <span style="color: red;">[unfair advantage to people with deep pockets/their <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/search/label/Tom%20Chapman">mum's credit card</a>?]</span>. Ideally players will also be able to submit custom models to us, and upon approval have their item <b>purchasable </b>through Steam like hats in Team Fortress 2 <span style="color: red;">[completely unnecessary&nbsp;bullshit IMHO but I guess some people (who play TF2, and not Insurgency BTW) are into that)</span><br />
<br />
KNIFE IS BACK!<br />
Due to popular demand we have re-introduced the knife to the game, for all you old-school INS players to salivate over</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><br />

I have been playing Insurgency since late 2008, and would really hate to see this mod die. I was very active on the old insmod.org forums under "The Ghost". I look forward to see what has become of Insurgency in the year or so that I've been inactive with the mod. I really hope that INS does not die a slow death of 24/7 Sinjar servers sitting empty day in/day out. Hopefully INS2 is a success.</blockquote><br />
