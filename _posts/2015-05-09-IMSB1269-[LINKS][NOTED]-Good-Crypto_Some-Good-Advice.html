<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Response 1:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
I think the author has not properly defined the problem. &nbsp;The first step to securing any system or information is to construct a threat model: _what_ do you want to defend, against _whom_? _What resources_ and capabilities does your attacker have? &nbsp;Which _compromises_ (usually reducing usability) are you willing to make? &nbsp;These questions have different responses when the above parameters vary.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Additionally, in my opinion, even if such a threat model were properly defined, the author does not approach the problem correctly. &nbsp;Here are some truisms I use when evaluating the security (however defined) of any system:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Software (and hardware) which is not publically-auditable is not trustworthy. &nbsp;Note that this does _not_ mean that publically-auditable software is trustworthy; publically-auditable code is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition, for trustworthiness.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) All software which processes untrusted input has exploitable vulnerabilities. &nbsp;This is not true in theory, but decades of surprising exploits prove this in practice. &nbsp;Some software has a higher defect density than others, but the proper approach is to reduce the size of the attack surface.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Encryption works only in very constrained threat models. &nbsp;Even assuming the cryptosystem is properly designed and the underlying crypto primitives are indeed "secure", a motivated attacker will easily sidestep these measures in most scenarios.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4) "Antivirus" software is dangerous: it gives a false sense of security. &nbsp;If an attacker can execute code on your system--either by physical access or remote code execution--your entire system is now untrustworthy.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
In general, no person can independently audit all security-critical parts of any system. &nbsp;Thus, security relies on trust. &nbsp;You trust chip designers, design IP vendors, EDA tools vendors, the chip fabricator, the fab employees making masks, the supply chain of your system integrator, the system integrator itself, the OEMs who write microcode and firmware, the distribution chain from those OEMs to your actual device, the software vendor, the distribution chain from the software vendor to your actual device, the supply chain of that vendor (was their compiler compromised?), ... and the list goes on. &nbsp;In all, you must, whether wittingly or not, trust literally millions of people and companies, and a violation of that trust at any one point can destroy your entire system security.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
With that said, let me elaborate on the above points and include some possible implications for the author.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Wherever possible, do not use proprietary services, software, or hardware. &nbsp;This means no Windows and no OS X, no Dropbox, no SkyDrive, no iCloud, etc.--at the very least. &nbsp;No email provider is secure. &nbsp;American companies may be particularly suspect, but this does not mean non-American companies are better. &nbsp;NSA compromised the Swiss crypto-device manufacturer Crypto AG--do you really feel safer using "Swiss secure" Proton Mail? &nbsp;If your mail must remain private, intentionally giving your email to a third party--_any_ third party--is just plain dumb. &nbsp;It's hard enough to defend as it is!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Critically analyze the attack surface of your relevant software; determine the size of the trusted computing base (TCB): what software and hardware do you rely on to properly deny or mitigate an attacker? &nbsp;Let's suppose you want to prevent a) hardware access (reflashing BIOS, hard drive firmware, etc.), b) access to the OS core (rootkits), c) access to sensitive data (Cryptolocker, bank info-stealing malware). &nbsp;Let's also suppose you use Microsft Windows and Internet Explorer.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; For an attacker to exploit your browser, you rely on millions of lines of code in Internet Explorer for image handling, JavaScript sandboxing, etc. &nbsp;Assuming sensitive data is not already accessible to the attacker, you then rely on thousands to millions of lines of kernel discretionary access control code to prevent access to that data. &nbsp;For an attacker to control the OS core, you rely on millions more lines of kernel code, and maybe millions more lines of user-mode code (e.g. LSASS). &nbsp;For an attacker to control the hardware or firmware, you rely on millions more lines of kernel/driver and firmware code, and the hardware itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, your TCB is astronomically large: you must trust so much code, that even if you assume the defect density is incredibly small, you can expect many vulnerabilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; A better approach is to start from first principles, like Qubes OS or Citrix. &nbsp;Isolate those parts of the system which must be isolated from each other, and rely on as little software, firmware, and hardware as possible to enforce the isolation.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Focusing on which crypto primitives are used is likely a waste of time, especially for a non-cryptographer: there are so many potential pitfalls in cryptosystem implementation, that a sophisticated attacker would never bother attacking the crypto primitives themselves, but rather the implementation. &nbsp;And don't forget the cryptosystem necessarily includes _you_, the user--and you're usually the weakest link.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think about this in traditional military terms: you have some territory to defend against an attacker. &nbsp;If you build an impenetrable 30km-high and 10-km deep wall of Uranium around 30 degrees of your perimeter, no attacker is going to waste time destroying the wall; they'll just go around it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Specifically for full disk encryption, forget about which primitives are used. &nbsp;Don't worry about whether 20km is tall enough: make sure there aren't giant gaps in the wall. &nbsp;The best way to do this is to use the most-audited code you can. &nbsp;In practice, this means using LUKS.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Don't rely on detection. &nbsp;In all cases but the most trivial botnet malware, you need prevention. &nbsp;Once cryptolocker encrypts all your files, it's already too late. &nbsp;Once NSA exploits your browser with QUANTUMINSERT, it's already too late. &nbsp;You must architect your system to provide the maximum defensive capabilities--before it's too late.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Finally, if you really _need_ security, don't use a computer. &nbsp;At the very least, never connect your computer to a network, never process untrusted data or connect untrusted devices, and _physically remove_ as many components as possible to reduce your attack surface.</blockquote>

There is another cypher system where two or more identical books are used which are only known to the users as this information is exchanged previously using some other secure method, such as WOMB. Once this information is set up, then the users can communicate by using sentences or words from the book, i.e. (page) 6...(line) 10... (sentence) (word) 5 etc. Pretty foolproof but clumsy and requires recipients and senders to have a special relationship, like knowing and trusting one another. Once book is compromised the cryptography fails. If transmitted over the internet, suffers same problem as any other encryption sent over the internet. Ball squeezing, same problem. Mind you, usingÂ such a system might actually be more secure than any of those what we have at the moment...:-). I can see us having to educate internet users into Book Literacy.

Things are getting quite, erm interesting here in the UK, a piece of legislation is being rushed through our parliament, but heres the interesting bit although it is being rushed through it is not classified as urgent. also comments have been made to the effect that, for a draft bill, parts appear to be very well developed. Even more intriguing is that this piece of proposed legislation dealing with widening powers perportedly in the name of counterterrorisim, appears to be supported by "stakeholders", a rather odd anomaly for a government bill supposedly drafted in conjunction with or on the advice of the UK security services. I think I have the PDFs somewhere both of the proposed bill, the explanatory notes and a draft committee meeting discussing the bill.</blockquote>

Unfortunately, it isn't about security software so much as your own personal needs and knowledge about security methods and how good you are at what is called "operational security", which counts the most. You can have the best encryption software in the world, but security is a chain, and the weakest link is nearly always the human being(s) using it. It is like having a hi fi system, no good spending a fortune on having the best quality amplifier, speakers, microphones, recording and playback media and sound proofed rooms, all matching the same standard and specification if you are deaf...like me...:-).

In an ideal world you could have unbreakable encryption, but that isn't the end of the story. Operational security is also important. A hard disk can be encrypted with unbreakable encryption, but forensic software can take the disk back to its "new" condition and analyse everything which was ever recorded on it, up to the point of the encryption. The encryption part can be broken by using a variety of methods, brute force, analytics, heuristics, or just plain bringing you before a court and, on the pain of imprisonment or other such punishment, force you, under law to reveal your passphrase. The nasty people will just threaten to squeeze your spherical objects. Traffic analysis can also be used to find out when, for how long, and who you are sending to or receiving data from.</blockquote>

2. Ive used protonmail before and it is a very decent system. It works by having an account on their server that serves your mailbox then on a client side there is a javascript file that takes a unique password to decrypt the mailbox. The only flaw with such a system is that what if someone poisons the wateringhole and infects the server that serves the javascript decryption library? I think they really need a desktop app for that. You could always double up on encryption and use pgp+protonmail if that attack is a concern for you. protonmail is based in switzerland which is pretty good and I do like the fact that all of the creators hold passports on different countries and they seem like a solid bunch as I found a XSS attack and they patched it promptly.
