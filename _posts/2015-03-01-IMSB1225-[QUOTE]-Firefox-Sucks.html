Firefox is going down. Here are some Slashdot quotes:

Remember when Firefox was born as the stripped-down next-generation of the Mozilla Suite? When it was all about getting the code base to the bare minimum and letting the user decide which functions and features they wanted, and let them have those via extensions?</blockquote>

Meh... Firefox has been on an increasingly-sharp decline to shittiness ever since version 3, which rapidly accelerated with 4 and the rapid-release bullshit schedule as well as all the changes for no good reason. Too bad no one ever forked the last good version (aka Firefox 2), and now we're all stuck with either Chrome or a Chrome rip-off, whether we want Chrome or not. I sure as hell do not, and therefore I am fucked. Hopefully the new browser by the guy who co-founded Opera actually turns out to be good, I always liked Opera... until they, too, shat all over their browser and made it yet another motherfucking Chrome wannabe (only going all-out in this case, literally basing it on Google's Chrome itself).</blockquote>

Mozilla is always playing catch-up these days.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Firefox? Well, Mozilla has spent the last few years doing everything they can to imitate Chrome. They've gone so far as to basically clone Chrome's UI. They're even trying to copy Chrome's process model, but Firefox's Electrolysis project is not going very well. They've been working on it for years, and even now it's still very buggy and broken.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Firefox for Android? Well, this is basically Mozilla's half-assed imitation of Chrome for Android. Pretty much nobody actually uses it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Firefox for iOS? Trick question, it doesn't even exist! They have absolutely no presence on iOS today.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Firefox OS? Well, this is Mozilla's attempt to get into the mobile space, a good half-decade too late. Every review I've read of Firefox OS and the devices it runs on has been very, very negative. I mean, these are some of the most negative reviews I've ever read about any device, ever. We've seen Mozilla try to get poor third-worlders to adopt Firefox OS, but even they don't want anything to do with it, it's that bad!</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Rust? Well, this is Mozilla's attempt to compete with Google's Go programming language. But while we've seen several stable releases from Go, and lots of useful software built using it, Rust is still spinning its wheels going nowhere fast. The 1.0 release will always be ready "within a few months". It's getting to the point where even Perl 6 is looking more likely to hit 1.0 than Rust is!</blockquote>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This useless device? Yet again, it's Mozilla trying to imitate what Google has successfully done, but again managing to do a very bad job at it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Mozilla is a joke. Mozilla's projects are a joke. I've never seen an organization fail so badly, so many times over.</blockquote>
