<blockquote>hello. lately there has been alot of nude/pornographic spray tag pictures in the test server and i was thinking if we can make a rule against that because i know there are children playing on the server and i do not think it should be allowed because of that. but ofc its up to you guys. [17 year old]</blockquote><br />
<blockquote>new rule: is your spray a super hot chick? well you must tell us who it is! because got dang that's frustrating</blockquote><br />
<blockquote>exactly.  i think you should just make a rule to not spray nude pics i mean like bikini photos and stuff like that is okay. but fully nude? don't think so [17 year old]</blockquote><br />

<blockquote>A brief history of my clan involvement:<br />
I started out in [Pi] (insurgency clan), and when [Pi] disbanded I joined *aBW. (A Beautiful World) a very proactive insurgency clan that had a clan mod project and released many custom insurgency maps.  I soon became a leader of *aBW. but eventually left to begin my own clan with a more effective structure.  Before I was able to launch my project, M@ximus contacted me and asked me to join ScK as a leader, I was happy to oblige and the three of us (M@ximus, Pendulum, and I) organized ScK into the glory it is today. I was a leader of ScK for over 6 months, and was even C.I.C. once or twice. Due to pressures at work, and thoughts of returning focus to my own endeavors, I decided to leave ScK; but I still remain close and supportive to the clan that still retains many of my closest friends.  </blockquote><br />
<blockquote>By the way, my turn-ons are:<br />
M@ximus (and his Love-Missile/Cock-Rocket)<br />
Bear-Skin Rugs<br />
MeBeam Crazy<br />
Ptereodactyl Porn<br />
Snakemuck's Intense Stare<br />
and being Spanked by Trouble</blockquote><br />
