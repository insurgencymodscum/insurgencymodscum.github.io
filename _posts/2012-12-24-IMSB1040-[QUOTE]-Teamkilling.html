There are only two explanations for people that say they have never accidentally teamkilled anyone:<br />
<br />
1. They are lying.<br />
<br />
2. They don't fire their gun often enough.<br />
<br />
Obviously none of those options are acceptable.</blockquote>

If you get teamkilled a lot, it might be a good idea to consider changing your tactics. I'm not blaming you for getting teamkilled, but there are certain things you can do to minimize the chances of it happening.<br />
<br />
I think the more aggressive type classes are obviously more prone to this as they spend more time inside the cap zones (at least they should) and possibly even behind enemy lines. The role of a rifleman is more to provide a cover of fire for the assault to move in, and they tend to stay behind.<br />
<br />
There's also the case of what I like to call "the flanker", they like to go as far as possible to the edge of the map, and sit there taking potshot, thinking this helps their team. They are, in my opinion, begging to get teamkilled.<br />
<br />
Anyway here's the basic precautions you can take:<br />
<br />
How not to get teamkilled:<br />
<br />
* Do not run towards your own team from the direction of the enemy.<br />
* Do not look out windows facing your side, that the enemy usually looks out of.<br />
* When far away from teammates do not point your rifle in their direction.</blockquote>
