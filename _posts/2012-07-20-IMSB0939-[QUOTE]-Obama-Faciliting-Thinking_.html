<blockquote>
How so? Obama came into office on "hope and change", and he just helped consolidate the police state Bush kicked off even more [and changed nothing]. Oh, and he went from torture to "kill lists", and he payed banks for being too greedy for their own good. He didn't change a fucking thing, he just lubed it up for you, all nice and sophisticated.<br />
<br />
No, all he (well, his handlers) did was pulling one on you, and you just sit there and celebrate it with empty phrases like "he facilitates thinking". For fucks sake? What does that even mean? Your BRAIN would facilitate thinking, IF you had one.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they simply implemented the same policies that are chugging along all the time, anyway, and this time with the diction of Tuvok instead of dumb smirks.</blockquote>
