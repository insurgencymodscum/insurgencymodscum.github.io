<blockquote>
The only EGO who seemed to care more about cheaters and griefers rather than his EGO status or EGO medals was Unknownow. He retired, and now half of EGO HLstatsX top 100 players are mentioned on this blog, but... that must be a coincidence, lol. Admins that consistently ignore cheating and griefing are just as guilty, see <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/search/label/Alan%20Harvey%20JackyD%20TeamCRG%20Zeggy%20Noorul%20Shahan">Alan Harvey and TeamCRG</a>.</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the great man of EGO (INS Divisions) in that time<br />
