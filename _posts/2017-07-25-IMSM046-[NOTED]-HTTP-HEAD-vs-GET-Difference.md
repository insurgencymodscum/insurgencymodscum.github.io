https://www.quora.com/HTTP-What-is-the-difference-between-GET-and-POST

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
HEAD - Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
PUT - Uploads a representation of the specified URI
DELETE - Deletes the specified resource
OPTIONS - Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
CONNECT - Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
