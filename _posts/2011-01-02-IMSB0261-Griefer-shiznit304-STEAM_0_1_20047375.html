Organization wanted: S.W.A.T. - Special Weapons and Tactics<br />
<br />
Organization Type: Law, Police<br />
<br />
What is it that your organization will do?: What my organization will do is when someone robs the store and they have a group of friends, about 5 of them or so, and the police can't handle the robbery we will send in S.W.A.T. Members to the robbery and we will help the Police.<br />
<br />
Organization Bio: How S.W.A.T. was made in Mevelport was, I was at the town Library looking up all the crimes on the computer. The crimes were very big and serious, I looked over the list, more than 10 people escaped armed robbery's, murders, selling drugs, selling guns, killing cops. So i decided, I will ask the government if I could make the S.W.A.T. organization and help stop the serious crimes in Mevelport. They agreed it was a good idea, so they had me apply on a government web page. They accepted the application and wished me luck to stop the crimes in the city. That, is how the S.W.A.T. was made. <br />
<br />
Member bios: Hello, my name is Jason Fare, I am age 31 and I lived in New York City for 29 years. I worked as the FBI there, solving a big case, and they moved me into the S.W.A.T., in New York City, being in the S.W.A.T. was a little to dangerous for me, my brother was worried that I would get killed cold blooded by one of the gangs in the city. I left New York City and moved to Mevelport leaving everything I owned behind, except my money, my papers, and my brother. I found a abandoned mechanics garage with the doors unlocked, that had been my home for 2 long years now. I was hoping to find a job, and I thought, I'm sure they have a S.W.A.T. team in this town. So I went out searching for the police department to ask. <br />
<br />
Why should we give you this organization?: I believe this organization should be given to me because I think we need more cops and I believe it would be a good org to have in RP with such a big city and many stores and because of all the crimes happening.</blockquote>
