Insurgency 2, now just "Insurgency" is now available on Steam for $15. Insurgency Mod veterans, griefers, and cheaters, it's time to get mum's credit card and let ... Insurgency begin... or continue if it never really stopped for you.<br />
<br />
InsModScum is optimistic, but Insurgency players must be <b><i>careful</i></b>. Insurgency <i>cannot </i>be another <i>Insurgency Mod</i>. It is up to <i>you</i>, to make sure that doesn't not happen.<br />
<br />
Insurgency Forum already has moderators with, let's say, <i>questionable </i>histories, trolls, some even from old Insurgency Mod Forum, armchair experts, again some are from old Insurgency Mod Forum, and scum that has been mentioned on this blog.<br />
<br />
Fifteen American dollars is not much, but when multiplied by thousands, is a lot of money. If you are a proper gamer, you <i>have</i> been burned in the past, so be <b><i>careful</i> </b>and let's not get disappointed and robbed again.<br />
