<b>Loodmoney's facts</b>:<br />
The MKb42(H) was produced in 1942. Given the gun's influence on world history in the space of time preceeding 1942, we must conclude that the MKb42(H) either has, invented, or is an integral part of, the capacity for time travel.<br />
The ROF of the MKb42(H) is such that it produces sound at a pitch that is pleasing to the human ear--more pleasing than any other gun. Two MKb42(H)s firing in a synchronised fashion will produce a sound at a pitch that is pleasing to the human ear--more pleasing than any other two guns firing in a synchronised fashion. Three--&amp;c. &amp;c. Thus, we must conclude that the music of Heaven above is composed of MKb42(H)s, and that if this gun did not exist, then neither would the speech of humans.<br />
People cry when they are shot by an MKb42(H), or simulations thereof. They also feel joy when they loot the gun off a dead body, or simulations thereof. Thus, the MKb42(H) is clearly responsible for the emotions and thoughts of Man. And, as the Soul of a man is responsible for his emotions and thoughts, therefore the Soul of Man is an MKb42(H). Our third conclusion from this is that, because a man's body and his Soul cannot be made of the same substance, the MKb42(H) is thus immaterial.<br />
