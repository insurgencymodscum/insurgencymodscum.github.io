Re: Tripwire Interactive LLC vs Daniel Zabriskie<br />
<br />
Mr. Zabriskie<br />
<br />
DEMAND IS HEREBY MADE THAT YOU CEASE AND DESIST all further disruptive activities on any Red Orchestra servers through either paid or free user accounts. Your ongoing disruptive conduct is in violation of the End User License Agreement that you agreed to when you loaded the game. It is also actionable due to your intentional interference with Tripwire's business by driving customers and potential new customers off the game servers with your conduct.<br />
<br />
This will not be tolerated. We have recorded your IP address and notified both your ISP and your parents of your activities. If you do not immediately cease and desist any further disruptive conduct formal legal proceeding will be instituted against you for the harm you are causing Tripwire Interactive and the Red Orchestra players.<br />
<br />
Tripwire has worked hard and long to create an enjoyable game experience for their community of players and your shameful conduct must stop. You are intentionally ruining the other player's game experience while at the same time harming Tripwire's business interests. If you do not stop now, you will be sued.<br />
<br />
THIS MATTER DEMANDS YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.</blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.abload.de/img/danielzabriskieuglypossp2a.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://www.abload.de/img/danielzabriskieuglypossp2a.png" width="189" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">Daniel "Zbrisk" Zabriskie.&nbsp;Fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on a way down.<br />
