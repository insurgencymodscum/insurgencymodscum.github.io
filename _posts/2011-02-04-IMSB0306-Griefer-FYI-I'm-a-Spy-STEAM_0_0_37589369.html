<blockquote>I decided to do some internet detectiving. First off, finding him. I searched his name on steamcommunity.com, taking special note of the capitalization of the "i" in "i'm". There were 3 people with the name "FYI, I'm a Spy," but his was the only one with an uncapitalized "i". Upon finding his profile, I added him, then struck up a conversation. He didn't reply until I offered to donate one of my confetti unusuals. He replied, still wasn't sure if it was him. After getting into a trade with him, it was pretty obvious he had everything rehearsed. It was for the Susan Reilly Foundation, named after an aunt of his who died. I asked if there was a website, he said it was under construction and should be done in a few months. It'd be at susanreillycf.org. The foundation didn't exist, and the domain isn't taken. I also asked him how much my confetti would get for the research, and he said something along the lines of "some people will go over board and pay 20." The normal price for a confetti is $25 to $30, overboard is $40+. He also said he did it in his spare time, yadda yadda, real life fund raiser, yadda yadda, a bunch of confidence-building junk. You get the gist.<br />
I'm pretty damn sure I've got him, so here's his Steam info.<br />
