Yehaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw!<br />

Finally, Moriarty got banned again. We should have a goodbye party for him but unfortunately he can't come because he got permabanned.<br />
<br />
Ahhhhhhhhh! So sad!<br />
<br />
We should give credit to F. [EGO member]<br />
<br />
P.S. I think we will see him again sooner or later.</blockquote><br />
Enjoy the ban Ben! IMS sends its regards.<br />
