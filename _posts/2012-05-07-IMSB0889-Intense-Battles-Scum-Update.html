<blockquote>Fake Intense Battles<br />
posted by Jordan .:IB:. @ 04:33PM on May 30, 2012<br />
It seems to say we have some IMMATURE people in this world. The opposite of Intense Battles and what we stand for. <br />
<br />
JUGGALORYDA, claims he will make his own intense battles...and steal our name... Let him... This is where the real intense battles is... And you will see it. <br />
<br />
The website that is not in this profile is UNAUTHORIZED FOR THIS INTENSE BATTLES GROUP. It is fake, do not sign up on it. When I post a website link, that will be the authorized group website for us.. Thank you... KEEP PLAYING!</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" />JESSE "INTENSE BATTLES" J. SCHMIT appears to be no longer actively playing Insurgency. Jordan .:IB:. appears to be running things.<br />
<br />
Intense Battles seems to be expanding their horizons, that is actively growing their cheating-griefing-incomptency skills by adding new talent - "Taargüs" (possibly A/K/A Jeff "reyalsnam" Hoffman) [STEAM_0:1:21106849 76561198002479427] and Ben (possibly A/K/A Ben Harrell) [STEAM_0:1:38441603 76561198037148935 STEAM_0:1:2656127 76561197965577983]<br />
<br />
Also all Intense Battles Cheating-Griefing Keyboard Warriors get arbitrary ranks now. Jordan is "<i>Lt. Jordan :2/8 IB:.</i>". Taargüs is "<i>1SG. Taargüs .:2/8 IB:.</i>".<br />

<br />
Hmmm... now what other person or persons would make a great addition to Intense Battles scum? You guessed it - Diane "BREJIFUS" "TRAILER PARK TRASH" Maes and her husband Tracy "BOTOR" "CUCKOLD" Joe Maes. BREJIFUS and BOTOR would have to be made Generals of course.<br />
<br />
BREJIFUS' server seems to be dying (running TAC Insurgency into the ground with her incompetence wasn't enough), so BREJIFUS becoming Diane "INTENSE TRAILER PARK TRASH BATTLES BREJIFUS" Maes seems like a win-win for everybody. It's only a matter of time. Don't forget IMS is <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/08/as-you-wished-247-custom-maps-no-stats.html">always</a>&nbsp;right.<br />
