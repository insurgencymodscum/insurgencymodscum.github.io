<blockquote>WOW. After being pepper sprayed by this sensuous essence, I'm not sure I ever want to be pepper sprayed by any other brand ever again. Seriously, the smoky chipotle combines perfectly with the subtle "spray" flavors. Really, an excellent and delicious tool for capitalist repression. Don't commit police brutality without it.<br />
This stuff really just does everything it says it does. You spray, and people will move. Hate waiting in lines? Hate people just sitting around and wasting valuable time doing nothing? Just hate people in general? If you answered yes to any of those things, then you are in for a peppery treat!<br />
The first week of owning this product I would have given it 5 stars. Now it would appear that college students are building up a resistance to the chemical mixture from all the exposure to it in the last few months. Last week I was a force to be reckoned with. This week these hippie college students are wiping the spray off their faces and eating it on their homosexual vegan salads they grew in Zucotti Park. If you ask me that's another thing we need to squash. Aint nobody needin to grow their own food when Uncle Sam can grow it for you. I have no evidence to back this up but I have 100% proof that the chemicals in this pepper spray are only 1 flavor off from that liberal Dr.Pepper soda. Alls you need to do is look at the tiny Arab or Mexican writing on the bottom of the can. AVOID THIS UNAMERICAN PRODUCT.</blockquote>
