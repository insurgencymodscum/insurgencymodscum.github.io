Insurgency (http://www.insurgencymod.net) was a game that I produced for 3 years or so. It was the first multiplayer game to allow you to fight in the (second) war in Iraq. It received some controversy because of this, despite winning awards including ModDB Mod of the Year.<br />

I was the original mind behind Red Orchestra (http://www.redorchestragame.com). I came up with the concept and produced the game until release. I was only sixteen when the game won its first phase of Epic Games' "Million-Dollar" Make Something Unreal contest. Tripwire Interactive (http://www.tripwireinteractive.com) was eventually formed by the Lead Programmer and Historian on the team. I was paid off and replaced because of my age.<br />
