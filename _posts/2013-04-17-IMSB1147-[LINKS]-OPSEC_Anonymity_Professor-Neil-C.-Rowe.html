Curriculum vitae for Prof. Rowe<br />
<br />
Some thesis and project topics<br />
<br />
Presentation on suggested thesis and dissertation topics<br />
<br />
Cyberwarfare and information security<br />
<br />
Develop methods of detecting insider threats to organizations from analysis of network traffic.<br />
<br />
Automatically correlate malicious packets sent to a honeypot with text descriptions of known attacks, to provide early warning on new attacks.<br />
<br />
Find clues to deception in analysis of the file directory on a captured disk drive.<br />
<br />
Implement software decoys for attacks involving denial-of-service, overwriting of the operating system, or stack manipulations.<br />
<br />
Systematically modify incoming attack packets to a honeypot to see what manipulations are most effective at confusing and foiling attacks.<br />
<br />
Develop effective "fake honeypots" and fake Web sites for counter-intelligence.<br />
<br />
Develop honeypot wireless devices that attract using deception and analyze wireless attacks.<br />
<br />
Develop anti-phishing tactics using deception.<br />
<br />
Develop technology for detecting cyberarms development in other countries.<br />
<br />
Develop methods to exploit intrusion activity for defensive purposes other than as honeypots. For example, ways of deciding priorities on intrusion tolerance, ways of determining when another organization should be informed, and ways of inciting revelation of key intelligence from an attacker adversary.<br />
<br />
Data mining<br />
<br />
Build a browser that automatically crawls the Web to find paragraphs with information about security threats or vulnerabilities of a specified type, regardless of the wording, using clues like vulnerabilty numbers and clustering of terms.<br />
<br />
Build an autonomous agent that gathers information from the Web about the organization (like people with job titles) of foreign governments.<br />
<br />
Build a neural network or Bayesian network that learns to categorize email or Web pages.<br />
<br />
Image processing<br />
<br />
Find suspicious behavior in video of public areas.<br />
<br />
Track Marines during training, figure out what they are doing, and measure their peformance automatically.<br />
<br />
Software engineering<br />
<br />
Parse and interpret the comments on a program to index it.<br />
<br />
Devise systematic naming conventions for programs and their components.<br />
<br />
Multi-agent simulation<br />
<br />
Implement a multiagent planning package as embeddable Java or Python module.<br />
<br />
Develop a training aid for urban warfare using multi-agent simulation.<br />
<br />
Develop a "red teaming" tool for counter-IED training, that plans out realistic insurgent actions.<br />
<br />
Model emotions like "anger" and "fear" in simulated agents in a two-dimensional world.<br />
<br />
Intelligent tutoring<br />
<br />
Apply the means-ends tutor to the teaching of repair using graphics.<br />
<br />
Infer planning criteria from lists of possible sequences of actions in operations, then use this to automate planning.<br />
