<blockquote>It takes years for people to acquire sufficient factual data to understand how the world really works. One can speed up the process by reading authors like Peter Dale Scott, Warren Hinckley, Alfred McCoy, et al. Turning the truth into surreality is about the only way one can put it out there in a pseudo-sophisticated, but thought-controlled society.</blockquote>
