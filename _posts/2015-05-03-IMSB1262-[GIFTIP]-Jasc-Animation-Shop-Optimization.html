TLDR:<br />
<br />
###<br />
<br />
Optimized Median Cut<br />
Less accurate (5 bit), Better weighting color importance.<br />
<br />
Optimized Octree<br />
More accurate (8 bit), Worse weighting color importance.<br />
<br />
###<br />
<br />
Error Diffusion<br />
Reduces colors by a mmethond similar to "nearest Color", except it spreads out the inaccuracy in representing a pixel's color to the surrounding pixels. This method produces a natural looking image.<br />
<br />
Nearest Color<br />
Reduces colors by replacing a pixel's original color with the nearest matching color in the newly generated palette. This method roduces a high-contrast image.<br />
<br />
Ordered Dither<br />
Images may appear to be composed of cross-hatches and dots.<br />
<br />
###<br />
<br />
"Nearest" significantly smaller file size than "Error".<br />
<br />
"Octree" quality slightly better than "Median".<br />
<br />
"Ordered" is shitty quality, small file size.<br />
<br />
<b>"Octree" &amp; "Nearest" is best.</b><br />

About Palette Options</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
When you decrease an image’s color depth, you must select a palette</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
option. Depending upon the color depth you select, two or three of</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
these methods are available:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Optimized Median Cut Measures and ranks each color by how</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
frequently it occurs in the image, then uses the most frequently</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
occurring colors to determine the new palette. Even if your image</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
contains fewer colors than the palette that is generated, this method</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
may not represent each color exactly. The method, therefore, is not</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
as accurate as the Optimized Octree method, but it is better at</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
weighting color importance.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Optimized Octree Creates an eight-level “tree” with eight branching</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
nodes totaling 256 individual “leaves” or colors to determine the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
new palette. This method attempts to reproduce each color in the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
original image, so if your image contains fewer colors than the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
palette that is generated, every color in the image is represented.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This method is faster and more accurate than Optimized Median Cut,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
but it is not as good at weighting color importance.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

Windows Changes each pixel’s color to the nearest color in the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Windows palette.</blockquote>

<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Standard/Web-Safe Palette Changes each pixel’s color to the nearest</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
color in the standard Web-safe palette. Use this method to create</blockquote>

images for the Web that can be viewed without color distortion on</blockquote>

About Color Reduction Methods</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
When you decrease an image’s color depth, you must select a color</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
reduction method. Depending upon the color depth you select, two</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
or three of these methods are available:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Nearest Color Replaces the original color of a pixel with the color in</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
the newly generated palette that is closest to the original RGB value.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This method eliminates dithering and produces a high-contrast</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
image. Simple graphics may look better with this method.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Error Diffusion Replaces the original color of a pixel with the most</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
similar color in the palette, but spreads the discrepancy between the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
original and new color to the surrounding pixels. As it replaces a</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
color (working from the top left to the bottom right of the image), it</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
adds the “error,” or discrepancy to the next pixel, before selecting</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
the most similar color. This method produces a natural looking</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
image and often works best for photographs or complex graphics.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Ordered Dither Adjusts adjacent pixels so that two colors give the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
illusion of a third color and intermingles pixels to produce patterns</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
based on a known palette. Use this method to give the image the</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
appearance of containing more colors than it actually does. Images</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
may appear to be composed of cross-hatches and dots and may have</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
distinct patterns of light and dark areas.&nbsp;</blockquote>
