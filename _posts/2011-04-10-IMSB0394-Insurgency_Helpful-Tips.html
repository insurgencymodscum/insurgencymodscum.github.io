<div style="text-align: center;">Kyuki's Tips</div></blockquote><br />
<blockquote>1. When stuck in reload limbo (if you're not fully empty) and you notice another opponent, jump up and the reload animation will stop. Thus allowing you to release what ammo you have left on the guy.<br />
<br />
2. If all else fails in the "Stop Reload Animation" trick, jump up again (while reloading, you can do this even without jumping up or reloading) hit H and drop your gun. You should automatically go into your secondary weapon.<br />
<br />
3. Eyes are a big factor in this game and so is handicordination [IMS: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsdrm_CxQw">shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</a>]. Playing on Dust 2 will help you with this if you just keep trying. This is where "No Scoping" can come into a big play factor in ANY map in Insurgency.<br />
<br />
4. RPG'ing isn't as easy at it seems. There's always risk that you can't avoid. For instance, while reloading, you are very vulnerable. Moving is twice as slow with any normal weapon, another vulnerability. Not to mention the fact that you have TEAMMATES who are most likely in front of you! Add all those up and it can create huge mess for everyone.<br />
<br />
5. Playing by yourself isn't always the key. There are objectives in the game that need one or more players. Most likely, if the server is full, you'll have 1-3 play makers on your team. Teaming up with them and creating a defensive matrix on a capture point, can be a bonus to your entire team.<br />
<br />
6. If you're a loner for the most part and just want to kill (Dust 2, right?) try slowing down the other team by moving around on the map. Sitting in one place will only make your opponents go the other way (if they're smart). Finding random hiding spots while moving along the way can create havoc on the other team and cause them to rush and not pay attention to the entire team or map.<br />
<br />
7. Grenades are very useful in tight situations. There are three ways in throwing a grenade. Left Mouse throw is just throwing it over hand with much delay in the initial explosion. Middle Mouse throw is lobbing it; holding it down further, it goes further. Right Mouse primes the grenade, this is very useful in a REALLY tight situation (a marine is 3 ft away from you).<br />
<br />
8. Sound is always a great advantage! Almost remember to check your headset settings, because sometimes they're probably on the wrong setting (like mine always do).<br />

<blockquote>1. Always keep moving, you will get most of your kills by breaking through the enemy's defenses and being able to wreck shop from places they don't expect.<br />
<br />
2. When using the M16, M4MED, I point the ironsights down so I can see over the top of them, when I engage somebody I simply pull up and let it loose. As you know the ironsights make it for a crowded viewing area.<br />
<br />
3. Double tap with M14<br />
<br />
4. Get a headset already<br />

<blockquote>1. DO NOT aim for the head if you have the SLIGHTEST doubt of missing. Lead the guy into your cross hairs and aim at his feet and let the recoil bring it up.</blockquote>
