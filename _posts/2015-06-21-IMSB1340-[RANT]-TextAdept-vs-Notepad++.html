INSMODSCUM hates Notepad++ and has tried very hard &nbsp;to adapt to TextAdept, but it has been hard. The following are some of my problems with TextAdept.<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />
Always show tab bar.<br />
Highlight current tab.<br />
Awkward naming.<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />
The above are not really "problems", but here's one: CAPS LOCK. Notepad++, &nbsp;happily ignores CAPS LOCK, TextAdept on the other hand, refuses to do anything if your CAPS LOCK is keyed.<br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />
Maybe this is some design decision, but it is infuriating.<br />
<br />
TextAdept is programmed by *one* guy, "Mitchell" (it was not easy finding this guy's full name BTW), and apart from the design choices &nbsp;and the CAPS LOCK issue INSMODSCUM hasn't experienced any bugs. Notepad++ on the other hand seems to be programmed by the same guys who programmed Adobe Reader and Flash.<br />

This is the second "regression" that INSMODSCUM have noticed. The guys behind Notepad++ are the most incompetent programmers on Earth. People have been editing text for forty fucking years, just how hard is it not to fuck up your software with every needless update?<br />
