Insurgentleman's Application for Admin<br />
<br />
I am on quite a lot. Also, I am on a lot of the times that no other admins are on, and it gets fairly ridiculous with the foreign players. I think the server would benefit a lot during the non-peak gaming times from some more admin help.<br />
<br />
Steam ID: STEAM_0:0:17675714<br />
<br />
In-game name: Insurgentleman<br />
<br />
Do you have experience with source-mod?: Yes, used to run an Age of Chivalry server with some friends of mine<br />
<br />
Do you have admin on other (MN) servers(if so please state them)?: Negative<br />
<br />
How long have you played insurgency?: About 2.5 years<br />

According to Gametracker, how many hours have you played on our server? Not sure how to look this up, but I would guess around 80<br />
