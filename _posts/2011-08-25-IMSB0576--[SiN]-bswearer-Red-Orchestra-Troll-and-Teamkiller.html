****Disclaimer: The following is not intended to be "raging" at Tripwire Interactive, merely stating facts which have led me to lose some respect for individuals under their authority......hopefully RO2's success will reignite my faith in them*****<br />
<br />
Zips: why u mad?<br />
Tripwire Interactive: sue me? please try......<br />
<br />
Banned from the Tripwire Interactive forums until October for reporting a power hungry, incompetent moderator named Zips who infracts users for "abuse of the report post functionality" (a rule that does not even exist). <br />
<br />
Silenced by member(s) of Tripwire Interactive's staff and put on "global ignore" in their forums for being an "annoyance" due to speaking the truth, which at times was too hard for certain people to swallow. Tripwire Interactive's solution to handling concerned, loyal customers? Allow incompetent moderators and abusive admins to Infract them....ban them....erase all history of their contributions to the community.....delete all evidence of their existance<br />
