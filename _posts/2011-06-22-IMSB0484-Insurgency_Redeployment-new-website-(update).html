INSMODSCUM would like to take this opportunity to thank all the testers especially the ones doing testing for 1.0 and the more recent post-2.5 updates. Those Insurgency 1.0 crashes set Insurgency on a path to success, and the 10 minute timing was perfect. And more recent spectate/end of round crashes were a great addition to Insurgency's realism. Players were ducking and dodging bullets left and right trying to avoid dying and the subsequent inevitable crash. Thanks testers! Job well done!</blockquote><br />

<blockquote><b>Just got a library card</b>. So until I get my pc either repaired or reimburst I can be here for 2 hours from 12-5 every day except holidays. <br />
<br />
Its been roughly 2 months since my pc broke down. At first it was a hard drive failure (which a tech was sent out to replace), Then we needed the recovery discs (which took about 5 buisness days to arrive), then the recovery process refused to go through so we had to call another tech to come dignose the problem (they lost my info twice, making a 2 week gap between recovery not working and him getting here), he got here and replaced the ram (which didn't work), then I called again to the company last thursday to tell them it didn't work (they informed me that a tech would be out here on tuesday to verify if the computer was irrepairable, which it obviously is), then I called them monday and they informed me that they don't have my order ticket   !, I (thouroughly pissed off) called again demanding service (they informed me theres nothing I can do but wait 4 MORE DAYS ). Now here I am waiting for the technician to come down here and tell me what I already know. This time I'm not going to let him leave unless I am told I'm getting reimburst or it is FIXED. I'm fucking tired of this company.</blockquote><br />
