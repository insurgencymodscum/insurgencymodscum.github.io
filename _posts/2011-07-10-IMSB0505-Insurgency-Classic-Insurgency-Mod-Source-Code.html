===================================<br />
====  INTRODUCTION    ====<br />
===================================<br />
<br />
After a recent IP dispute over the INSURGENCY: Modern Infantry Combat (http://www.insmod.org) project, a total conversion<br />
modification for Valve's Source Engine, the original developers have decided that it's in the best interest of the mod's<br />
legacy to be released as an open-source project.<br />
<br />
Many developers (over 40) have worked on the project in various forms, however there is still much room for improvement.<br />
No one deserves to profit off of the mod, nor get in the way of its progress. By making the mod open source we are<br />
releasing and supporting one of the more advanced open source game APIs that exist, allowing any programmer or developer <br />
that signs up to make the improvements and additions that they wish. As far as open source projects go, Insurgency provides <br />
developers with a great opportunity because of the game's countless complex, unfinished features; and its potential to be <br />
upgraded to Orange Box and improved upon significantly. <br />
<br />
This is the first revision of the Insurgency Classic project. Included is the full C++ Source of the game. As time goes on,<br />
original developers will upload map source (.VMF), model source (.SMD/.QC) and 3ds max (.MAX) files, to allow developers to get<br />
even more in-depth with additions to the game. We leave releases in the hands of the community that emerges. Once something<br />
is compiled and stable, we encourage developers to upload the version to the Files section of the project homepage.<br />
<br />

<br />
A wiki is planned as well.</blockquote>
