<br />
Age:&nbsp;28<br />

Weekly Availability (in GMT-7 Mountain Standard Time):&nbsp;I work from home, so as long as it's scheduled, I should be able to make it.<br />
System Specs:&nbsp;1) Q6600@3GHz, 6GB RAM, 6850HD [W7-64]... 2) i7-2670M, 8GB RAM, 7950M [W7-64]... (also a P4 w 6200, and semperon on 880G)<br />
Your experience with Insurgency Mod:&nbsp;Over 3000 hours logged (3000 just since steam release, so I'd wager another 2000 min on top of that). Been in since 2007 I think? Led [sT] competitive team with excellent record sponsored by |LMC|, also led the LMC community team. <b>Created WAR mod</b>, and hosted INS WAR event. A Leader of |LMC| community (lmcgaming.com) which hosts the pistols only mod server, &amp; practice range server (also previously the WAR mod sever). Constructed the INS weapon qualification exams open to all, standardized skills tests. Was a leader of *aBW. ran the #4 server for INS before the steam release, all custom maps. Previously a leader of -||ScK||- before it split and became reinvented as LMC. Led 3 competitive teams for insurgency, all with great success. Proud supporter of Insurgency, and self-titled INS evangelist. lol =D Would love to help!</blockquote><br />
"WAR mod" or&nbsp;at least&nbsp;part of it was created by Insurgency Mod Scum 1, modified by -|TDB|- SSG.Dylan AKA Dylan AKA The Ghost (STEAM_0:0:16045515, 76561197992356758) without attribution and later used by LMC&nbsp;KauaBoi to base his "WAR mod" on.<br />
