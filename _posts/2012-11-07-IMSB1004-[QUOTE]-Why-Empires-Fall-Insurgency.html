With regards the "terrorist mind set", in the case of most of these wars we are not fighting terrorists but people who see themselves as defending there homeland and way of life against "The Big Satan".<br /><br />If you think back a while you have probably heard the name "Bomber Harris" who implemented carpet / wide area bombing, and eventually "fire storms" in all out air attack on the enemy (Germany WWII).<br /><br />Well the argument for this was not made by Bomber Harris but one of Winston Churchill's closest scientific advisers who was a well respected professor.<br /><br />It you get the chance to read the papers written that argued for it it all came down to "destroying the enemies moral" loosely disguised as destroying war production.<br /><br />Well every single argument about "defeating moral" is hypocritical, because it was always argued that no matter how bad it got for us "our stiff upper lip" would get us through, whilst the enemies "moral degeneracy" would make them collapse...<br /><br />The simple thing is normal every day people when pushed into a corner will fight tooth and nail to defend "Me and Mine". You see this sort of courage with people rushing into suicidal conditions such as raging fires to rescue what they have and love. It might not be rational but that's the way it is.<br /><br />But on top of this is revenge, it is no joke when people say somebody would walk across burning coals to get revenge, it's happened and will continue to happen. Sometimes all you have left is the desire to make somebody pay for what they have take away from you. It may be destructive but it is very powerful.<br /><br />Put simply never underestimate peoples desire for revenge or their courageousness the most unlikely of people will not break under torture and will do what it takes to get a job done even with their last breath. As history has shown these people may be one in a thousand but just a handful will give others the same courage and sense of purpose. At the end of the day it's one of the reasons Empires fall.
