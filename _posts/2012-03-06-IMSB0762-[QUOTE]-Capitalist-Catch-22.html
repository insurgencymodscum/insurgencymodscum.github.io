<blockquote>If you study capitalism you eventually learn it's pretty much like the movie, people are born into money, "old money", that entire class is kept separate from the exploited. This is&nbsp;an unfortunate fact that has to occur because without exploitation there wouldn't be the country's infrastructure. So even though capitalism is inherently evil by keeping those in money constantly separate from the working class to the point that those in the money can never really lose it. Look at Donald Trump as an example, bankrupt 2 or 3 times, but is he ever really broke? No, he's a billionaire and will die a billionaire while the working class will bust their humps day in and day out and live paycheck to paycheck with as much chance getting into another tax bracket as winning the lottery. It's an enslavement system, tut it's an enslavement system that has to happen. We have to have the working class or the country falls apart, no infrastructure, no food, The rich live off of us like leeches but if we don't do our jobs we also die, it's a catch 22.&nbsp;There is no real solution to capitalism, to destroy it would bring down not just the rich upper class but also the working class.You poor fools have been lead to&nbsp;believe&nbsp;that one day you too will be rich and powerful. It's the capitalist way right? Wrong! You will toil in the gutters with the rest of us, your back breaking from trying to carry the enormous credit debt you've amassed trying to live up to your image as a&nbsp;successful&nbsp;person.</blockquote>
