<blockquote>Dear Steam Users and Steam Forum Users:<br />
<br />
Our Steam forums were defaced on the evening of Sunday, November 6. We began investigating and found that the intrusion goes beyond the Steam forums.<br />
<br />
We learned that intruders obtained access to a Steam database in addition to the forums. This database contained information including user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses and encrypted credit card information. We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating.<br />
<br />
We don’t have evidence of credit card misuse at this time. Nonetheless you should watch your credit card activity and statements closely.<br />
<br />
While we only know of a few forum accounts that have been compromised, all forum users will be required to change their passwords the next time they login. If you have used your Steam forum password on other accounts you should change those passwords as well.<br />
<br />
We do not know of any compromised Steam accounts, so we are not planning to force a change of Steam account passwords (which are separate from forum passwords). However, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to change that as well, especially if it is the same as your Steam forum account password.<br />
<br />
We will reopen the forums as soon as we can.<br />
<br />
I am truly sorry this happened, and I apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />

It was only a matter of time before Valve's booty was pillaged by either the good guys or the bad guys. Unfortunately the bad guys, that is, kiddie scum who are connected to <a href="http://fkn0wned.com/">http://fkn0wned.com</a>/ (cheating and griefing forum) found the treasure chest first.<br />
<br />
Anybody involved in banning any cheating or griefing scum should expect to be doxed.<br />
<br />
If connection to <a href="http://fkn0wned.com/">http://fkn0wned.com</a>&nbsp;is a misdirection (highly unlikely), and Steam hackers <i>are </i>the good guys, Insurgency Mod Scum hopes they will not be greedy, and will share their booty with the Internet (start with "myg0t").<br />
<br />
Valve, this is what happens when you find a stranger in the alps (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRHwdOcYQbI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRHwdOcYQbI</a>), the "stranger" being Steam users. Valve partly depends on cheating, griefing scum to repeatedly purchase games in order to avoid VAC. It was only a matter of time before this cheating, griefing scum moved from hacking Valve games to hacking Valve servers.<br />
