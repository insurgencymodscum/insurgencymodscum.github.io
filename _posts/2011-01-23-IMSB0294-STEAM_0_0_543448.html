Blogger/Blogspot compared to Wordpress is a piece of shit. Blogger/Blogspot (owned by Google) can't even properly index numerous Insurgency Mod Scum posts.<br />
<br />
For example, searching for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=STEAM_0:0:543448">STEAM_0:0:543448</a>" should lead to "<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2010/06/cheater-ensign-chekov-steam00543448_17.html">Cheater - Ensign Chekov STEAM_0:0:543448 wallhack</a>". According to Google it shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Insurgency Mod Scum is not even going to write about the completely useless "Search Box" gadget, created by Google, provided by Blogger. Words would not be able to describe that FUBAR piece of de fucking facto shit.<br />
<br />
And Insurgency Mod Scum is not going to even mention Blogger/Blogspot and lack of templates/themes that don't ALL look like a Myspace page of a 13 year old girl circa 2004 or a cupcake shop.<br />
<br />
But at least Blogger/Blogspot/Google are not <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2010/09/email-wordpress-insurgencymodwordpressc.html">hypocrites</a>.<br />
<br />
Thanks A. for the tip.
