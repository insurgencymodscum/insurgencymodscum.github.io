<blockquote><div style="text-align: left;">Who are CodeRed Gaming?</div><div style="text-align: left;">CodeRed Gaming or TeamCRG for short was formed in July 2006 as a single Counter-Strike Source team playing for fun in the low end of the scene. Very quickly we grew into a Multi Game Organistation supporting a variety of teams across different game genres from Counter-Strike Source to Fifa 10. We now currently support 3 teams spanning across the UK, Russia and Iceland.</div><div style="text-align: left;">We believe we have a great set-up from which we can help our teams to progress as much as possible. Behind this is an extremely dedicated management team who ensure that every need is taken care of behind the scenes.</div><div style="text-align: left;">From this support we have seen our teams climb to the top of ladders and have some very respectable finishes in both online and offline cup events.</div><div style="text-align: left;">At the moment we are currently preparing for the upcoming summer Lan series and competing in as many online competitions as possible.</div><div style="text-align: left;">CodeRed Gaming aim to become a registered limited company in the near future to help us progress and enable us to sell our own range of Lan clothing and other products.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />

We are also competing the the ClanBase Eurocup Invite Cup where we are currently placed at the top of our group. This team will be attending both Epic Lan 6 and Multiplays Insomnia 43 where we hope to make a big impression.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Our Benelux based Css team have just joined our organisation after we saw a lot of potential following their recent appearance at The Party 9 in Holland where they came a very respectable 3rd place knocking out 1st seed LowLanLions on the way. They also recently won the ESL Winter Cup.</div><div style="text-align: left;">This team will be attending Multiplays Insomnia 43 in August as well as any local Benelux lans that come up.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Our Nordic based Css team has recently just undergone a complete roster reshuffle after some unfortunate results meant things had to change. They will be competeing in the ESL Nordic Amateur series and we hope to see this new roster step up to the challenge.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Our Russian based Call of Duty4 team have gone from strength to strength over the last few months bringing in some very impressive results against some established and respected teams. Having just earned entry into the academy invite channels we hope they continue their progression and earn the rights to be in the pre.invite channel.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Recently they have been playing in the ESL where they have been playing extremely well and only missing out on a few finals due to the time difference between the EU and Russia. They have also been playing in the local leagues in Russia where they have been turning a lot of heads and making their way to finals and beating respected teams on the way. This team will be attending any local Lan events that come up in Russia over the coming months where we hope to achieve a top3 finish.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Over the last 5 years, TeamCRG has gone from strength to strength, achieving some impressive results and striving for bigger cup and event wins. With our UK Counter-Strike Source team sitting 1st in the EAS amateur series with a strong chance of promotion to the next division, also with a direct invite to the Clanbase Eurocup XXIV Invite Cup.</div><div style="text-align: left;">We have also just signed the team formally known as POPPERS who have just returned from The Party9 where they finished 3rd knocking out first seeds LowLanLions on the way.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Our Russian Call of Duty4 team are going from strength to strength with some very impressive results coming in lately against some top end teams. We have just been accepted into the pre.invite channels and will be attending the next Russian lan where we aim for a top 3 finish.</div></blockquote>
