Interesting idea, except... CNN? Fareed Zakaria? Bill Maher?<br />
<br />
There's a reason people watch VICE - it is not mainstream media where everything is owned by five or six guys. Now they have CNN and Bill Maher, who sometimes has interesting guests on his Real Time program, and even has moments of brilliance himself but is otherwise more bloodthirsty than the usual MSM he likes to put down so much. CNN is nowhere near the "fringes" VICE likes to report on and will probably bring their typical "smugness" to VICE reports. Bloodthirsty and smug, great, just great!<br />

And I hope they got rid of that nerdy guy with glasses.
