The Layover (2017)

The absolute greatest movie of all time
10/10
Author: ZeroReviews
5 September 2017

The absolute greatest movie of all time. Hands down. My future wife, Alexandra Daddario, and future second wife, Kate Upton, play best friends competing for the affection of a man who I would kill to be.

Both actresses really bring their best... "assets" to this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen because I couldn't look away from their... "acting chops." Their "talent" really shines in a scene which takes place in a swimming pool where both women are just being the greatest thing God ever created. They are living proof that there is a God. They deserve Oscars for their performances. The producers, writers, and casting directors all deserve Oscars for putting Alexandra and Kate together for our enjoyment.

This film is also very emotional. I went through at least twenty tissue boxes watching this film.

I'd give it an 8008 out of 10 if I could.
