Move over ANZINS (oh you've already moved back to arma2?!) LMC is determined to take your place.<br />

Stumbled across this when I googled LMCgaming...<br />

You are a piece of shit.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not even basing that on the total underestimation of LMC.  I'm hardly going to address that - I'll just tell you the history of LMC in competitive play in Insurgency.<br />
<br />
Here's why you're a piece of shit:  we all know Insurgency is heading in the wrong direction (if heading in a direction at all) and I'd say that the majority of the community agrees with the whole principle of no confidence toward the current development team.  So why attack the only thing Insurgency has?  A shrinking community that remains dedicated in hopes that this awesome game will eventually become awesome...and if we don't get that at least we had fun along the way.  You are a piece of shit because you are being a douchenozzle to the people who actually care about Insurgency.<br />
<br />
History lesson:  LMC has competeted in the following things over the last two years:<br />
ESL North American Insurgency Cup (2nd place, D3 won).  The only serious competition (sorry TDB, I know you'll bring more to this upcoming event) we had besides D3 was ScK - who "won" one match due to a technicality that any member of that team would dispute to this day - who we defeated after having to work our way back from the loser's bracket.<br />
eGO's Ladder - Delayed Reaction went undefeated against North American clans.  Only clan to beat us was ANZINS (Australia and New Zealand based community).  Unfortunately we dropped out after 6-8 matches due to engagements outside of gaming.<br />
TDB's 1st Insurgency Cup - Guess who took 1st and 2nd place?  LMC...and LMC.  KauaiBoi led the community team to an undefeated title - and Delayed Reaction only lost to LMC.<br />
<br />
If you have the balls to come on our forums and post a response - I'll disrespect you a little less.</blockquote><br />
INSMODSCUM especially likes how they have two teams a high skill LMC team and an appropriately named "Delayed Reaction" (those guys just couldn't get into the regular LMC team; reason? bad reaction time would be my guess). Perhaps they should recruit some more members for their "Delayed Delayed Reaction" team?... and then have 3 teams from the same clan in the competition?<br />
<br />
BULLETS better pawn these douchebags.<br />
