<blockquote>InsurgencyÂ® 2 is a standalone online PC and Mac game that puts the player in strikingly realistic modern day conflict zones. The original Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was first released as a free mod on Steam back in 2007, and has since been <b>downloaded by over a million </b>people and formed its own small but dedicated gaming community. <br />
<br />
NWI has assembled the original core team to make a remastered [IMS2: it's still not a fucking song] version of the game, which will expand the game to include 'Unrest in <b>Chechnya</b>', 'Revolution in <b>Libya</b>' and 'Piracy in <b>Somalia</b>'. <b>The game will be ported from the 2006 version of Source Engine to the most recent version of the engine that was used for Portal 2</b>, featuring HD graphics with new and improved levels and gameplay. <b>The Insurgency will return to Steam in 2012.</b></blockquote><br />
<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/10/insurgency-shitty-name-remastered.html">Insurgency Remastered?</a> Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit... That was just a working title. Insurgency has a proper name now. Expect forum debates regarding "unrest" and "revolution" phrasing.<br />
