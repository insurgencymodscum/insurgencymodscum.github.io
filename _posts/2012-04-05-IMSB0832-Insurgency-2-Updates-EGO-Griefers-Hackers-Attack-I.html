<blockquote>This is not a mod. On the contrary, we've put a lot of time and <b>money </b>into this, <b>so it will not be free</b>. <br />
<br />
The exact price tag hasn't been decided yet, as it depends on how much content is in the game when we launch (which is at least half a year away). <br />
<br />
We released the alpha gameplay footage not to show you what INS2 is going to be like, but to show you that it exists in a very early alpha stage. The game will be much more valuable when it's finalized and we are confident that the price tag we do place on it will be completely reasonable for what you get.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" />New World Interactive Forums seems to be attracting more and more scum, particularly former and current EGO members and administrators.<br />

INS Experience:<br />
Hey I'm RubberBullet I've been playing Insurgency since it was first released. I've always thought that insurgency was the best free fps game I've ever played. <b>Grunt0311 </b>referred me to this site to see about being a beta tester. I'm more than willing to give my opinions and possible suggestions. I'm an avid Gamer so I'd be available the majority of my evenings. I'm experienced in many FPS Games such as BF3, MW3, and so on.<br />

Friends with many of the die hard INS players [correction: die hard griefers-cheaters and incompetent admins; Mohawk when he was an EGO admin, showed the same administration skills as the scum he presently associates with] and have been waiting patiently.<br />

I got into INS a few years ago and saw great potential that's why I stayed with it. I think it has the perfect mix of realism and fun gameplay. I have been folowing the news on INS 2 for as long as it has been coming, so when I saw this thread I had to throw my hat in the ring and hopefully help make INS 2 better.<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: left;">Previous post regarding beta test applicants can be reviewed here:</div><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/insurgency-2-alpha-test-developers-and.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/insurgency-2-alpha-test-developers-and.html</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/insurgency-2-alpha-new-world.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/insurgency-2-alpha-new-world.html</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/michael-killy-killerton-ederer.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/michael-killy-killerton-ederer.html</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;">Insurgency griefer-cheater-incompetence presence on NWI Forums is strong, <i>but it can be stronger</i>. At least two important griefer-cheaters are absent: Tom, representing the Insurgency Non-material-based-wallhack Cheaters, and perhaps COMBINE, who can represent Insurgency Griefers and sub as a Material-based-wallhack representative when Tom is away. Of course MurderNetworks AKA 187ci members and administrators are lifetime representatives&nbsp;for Incompetent-griefing-admins everywhere.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;">Insurgency veterans will probably be able to partly thank the above mentioned scum for all the bullshit, COD-esque features, NWI implements in Insurgency 2. If Insurgency 2 feels nothing like Insurgency 1, Insurgency Mod Scum readers would know who is&nbsp;responsible.</div></div>
