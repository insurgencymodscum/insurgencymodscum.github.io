Complaint about abusive player.<br />
<br />
Name is American Tillie, I am aware that he is friends with the admins on your server but I will still take the risk of being banned for making this thread. <br />
<br />
A couple of days ago he decided I was a hacker, and without any evidence he started making accusations.. not that I really care. But when, every time I log on he says things like "oh its the fag hacker" and "the bus fag is back" (my name is "the bus cant swim" atm in reference to the nobody canna cross it song), it gets a bit much.<br />
<br />
I know I should have made a demo or whatever, but I really don't see why when there have been admins on when he is saying this and they really don't seem to care, in fact they seem more interested in gaining proof that I am a hacker instead of enforcing the rules.<br />
<br />
Also, wanna hear something funny? I was gonna make an app to join you guys before you started hating me.. lol wouldn't that have been a laugh.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Nickamortis  <br />

This is bullshit, and you shouldn't have to put up with that. <br />
I'll see If I can get someone to check chat logs and what not, but what would really help us out is if you got some screenshots of this happening. Do you know which admins have witnessed this?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you got the wrong idea of how this community works, I really am. We don't condone this behavior at all.<br />
If you can get on vent and let me know when this is going on the second it happens, I'll personally bring an end to this.<br />
<br />
I typed this while inebriated and am very impressed how well I stayed on topic (this took 15 minutes to type)</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>brando  <br />

As Nick said, it would help a lot if you could let us know which admins you've seen in-game while this is happening, so we can talk to them about it, so we can set some stuff straight.<br />
The main reason I'm posting is just to say that I like your name. That video never gets old. Hopefully something happens to make this stop. I really think games like this should have an ignore function.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Cracovia <br />

American Tillie is know as Combine. Is the same player. He always say shit if omeone kill him. He always saying to me that I'm the Haker even he spect me. He dont respect others players. If there is no admins he broke rules like shooting from spawn. <br />
He already get kicked cuz he talk shit to player who have admins right but he play without MN tag. And during my last game on Dust he get ban for talking shit to me. So this is not all true that admins dont take care with him <br />
True is that some admins do nothing with such behevior as far he dont start talk to them.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Jessica  <br />

Yikes, someone's a little pressed.<br />
You're complaining too, and aren't exactly behaving like an "adult" either.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Liquid Tension Experiment  <br />

I'm not "pressed", stay calm. <br />
I only reported what's going on these days on the insurgency server, because, as I've already said, is really annoying.<br />
HEAT and INeedBandAid are always present on the server, and they're doing a really good job here [lie]. Don't you think that if they thought that we use hacks, they would already banned us [HEAT is incompetent]? Also considering that are two years that we play every day on this server? </blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Mortified Penguin  <br />

OHHHHKAAAAAAYYYYYYYY. COMBINE is just as Liquid said a very very very skilled player, and he knows that. So what happens is whenever someone kills him, he begins to rage and cuss/slander the person who kills him. I have never banned him because I know that he is just raging and is otherwise harmless. He is all bark and no bite, if you know what I mean. His attitude has never been bad enough to warrant a ban, but now it seems as if it is getting worse. If you can get a demo/screenshot of this happening, or if me or any ins admin witness's it, we will ban him. We hope this doesn't drive you away from our server and would love to see you join the community.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Jessica  <br />

Just saying, he's getting abuse from another player and you basically just told him to shut up about it. It wasn't helpful and was a little rude. :/</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Liquid Tension Experiment  <br />

The meaning of my comments, obviously, was not aimed to say stfu to him. I've only reported the other side of the controversy, for a better understanding and objectivity.<br />
Anyway, never mind, our insurgency admins are already trying to resolve this situation, this is all that count.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>evilelmo  <br />

So you don't think it's good that it's been brought to attention?<br />
I don't see that as whining on the forums, I see it as taking initiative to keep the server fun for everyone. <br />
<br />
It's not immature to seek for help, especially when it benefits more than just 1 person.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Liquid Tension Experiment  <br />

I simply don't like the way he reported this fact, because I read a bit of hypocrisy in what has been written, and I explain why: COMBINE doesn't start to offend other players for nothing, for no reasons, but he starts only when the other players provoke him, and this happens very frequently, because of his skills.<br />
I keep to defend him because I'm in the same situation, and I understand how annoying is.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Cracovia  <br />

Liquid you dont have courage to say true or you play to long on PC and you live in an imaginary world. "...he starts only when the other players provoke him..." how i ask you? None talk to him. If they provoke him by killing him I can say sorry but they have to kill him. <br />
The best proof is ban list:<br />
http://bans.murdernetworks.com/index...ist&amp;advSearch= <br />
Search list by his steam ID : STEAM_0:1:47056365<br />
He got 2 time ban for bad behevior. He was provoke by admins? Dont make joke on MN Admins. I play on almose all servers and I can say MN have one off the best admins. They keep smothe and clean game. <br />
You see to me is normal that someone say that I'm hacking. This is no problem he can say such a crap as many time he want. But he dont stop on this. He go much more further. And thats why he broke server rules in my opinion.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Liqued if Combain start insult others player you immediately help him it that.<br />
<br />
Here some talk of him in chat ( You can find it in Chat stats ):<br />
