In order to get a useful response you're going to have to give us more information. You can't expect to give vague information and expect everyone to get being you. I'm going to respond based on what I feel is the most likely scenario - which I accept could be totally wrong. <br />
<br />
Taking a wild stab in the dark I'm assuming you're being held in contemp of course due to a failure to divulge encryption keys on request. If this is the case, then it will be up to the courts to decide if he you geninely forgotten the password/keyfile location (which is a common defence) following a forensic examination of your machine. In my view, I think it's more likely that you're being intentionally obstructive and for whatever reason do not want the investigators to know what's being held in your encrypted volume. <br />

<b>I don't delieve the FBI waste their time investigating individuals they believe to be innocent </b>with the ultimate aim of wasting even more tax payer's money keeping them in jail for years. They must have a good reason for arresting you and an equally good reason for you being kept behind bars for contempt of court.<b> Chances are you are guilty of the crime you have been arrested for </b>and you are not allowing access to your encypted data because you feel it will get you more than 14 years in jail.</blockquote>
