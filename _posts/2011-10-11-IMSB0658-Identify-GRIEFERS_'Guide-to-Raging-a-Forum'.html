Guide to raging a forum without spamming<br />
Written by: Nineteen84<br />
<br />
#1 Make sure you can change your IP, if you can't they only have to IP ban you once before you have to use proxies which are slow and gay.<br />
<br />
#2 Give your self a name like "Hitler" or "realist ******". When they say "omg you have Hitler as your name you are racist" you say "my name is tony Hitler and Hitler is my second name" there will then be a massive flame war between regular people on the forum over weather you should keep your name.<br />
<br />
#3 Lie lie and lie. If the forum is about something like a video game, make stories about how the game is coming out in a few months or make fake screenshots so that people actually believe the lies. When they find out they are fake they will be really really raged and stuff because you got their hopes up. there will also be wars between the believes and the non believes in your ****<br />
<br />
#4 Make **** up about people on the forum. Claim that some members are racist, post ugly but believable pictures from hotornot and claim they are members and generally make people laugh and say "i always knew xxx was a loser"<br />
<br />
#5 Suck up to admins/mods while stirring **** between regular members. admins and mods will find it harder to warn or ban you while regular members get raged. On a lot of forums people don't like the admins or mods so you get bonus raging points for acting like they are really cool<br />
<br />
#6 Act like a noob., talk ****, use leet speak, don't bother with grammar/punctuation etc act stupid when a mod or admin warn you<br />
<br />
#7 Always use caps, when people tell you not to, say you have a problem with your eyes and that its hard for you to type in normal letters<br />
<br />
#8 Contradict your self. in a few posts say how you hate X then start praising him.<br />
<br />
#9 Pretend to be from some sort of ethnic group. My favorite is claiming to be a Slav or a Jew then starting topics like "discuss XXXX - SLAVIC MEMBERS ONLY". This causes ****. At every available opportunity claim how Russia/Israel/Bulgaria is amazing, Provoke racist comments from other members to start wars.<br />
<br />
#10 Pretend to be something cool like a member of CDC. people will get pissed off and flame you saying that your lying and stuff. another great one is pretending to be famous internet people like Maddox and ****<br />
<br />
Final note: The true art of raging a forum is not spamming, this can be cleaned up pretty quickly. It is to set members against each other and cause rifts that will ultimately destroy the forum.<br />
<br />
Extra: Gaining an admin password or finding a nice loophole to **** around with is also amazing raging potential. Recently this forum I was raging let you upload your own emotion icons for the whole forum to use when you had enough posts. There was a limit on one every 300 posts or something, but I found that if you just bookmark the page url you can upload unlimited ones. I then uploaded tubgirl pics and linked them to words like "the" "to" "from" etc.<br />
<br />
If you manage to get an admin password, delete all forums and make one forum called "discuss how raged you are"</blockquote>
