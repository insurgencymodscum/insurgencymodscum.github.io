Update: YT video removed. See the following for updates:&nbsp;<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/05/insurgency-mod-scum-blog-sticky.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/05/insurgency-mod-scum-blog-sticky.html</a><br />

<br />
(1)&nbsp;<b>Score</b>.<br />
<br />
(a) Loud score makes the gameplay looks more COD-ish than it probably is.<br />
<br />
(b) Impression this Youtube video gives is the game looks like a polished beta trailer, rather than alpha gameplay.<br />
<br />
(c) Showcase the gameplay or the score, not both.<br />
<br />
(2)&nbsp;<b>HUD</b>.<br />
<br />
(a) Hope all that HUD shit is toggable. I really don't give a shit about the heart health (EKG graphs) of the people in the capzone (minimalistic names and whether they are dead or not is good enough). IMHO the only information you need on the HUD is the number of magazines (perhaps displayed when you reload [RO2 style]).<br />
<br />
(3)&nbsp;<b>Weapons</b>.<br />
<br />
(a) Don't&nbsp;<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/red-orchestra-2-death-64-player-servers.html" rel="noreferrer" style="border: 0px; color: black; list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">RO2</a>&nbsp;(read: fuck up) Insurgency 2 up. Pick a base value and use real world recoil data (real world data might not be available for MP40). Choosing recoil values out of thin air or to "balance" the gameplay is too COD.<br />
<br />
(b) Use real world data such as length, and width for weapon handling values [IMS1].<br />
<br />
<br />
(4)&nbsp;<b>Maps</b><br />
<br />
(a) ins_ramadi is notorious for spawn exit camping. If half of Insurgent team decides to exitcamp (or just 3 or 4 very&nbsp;determined&nbsp;Insurgents), USMC are fucked. Insurgency 2 maps must be (re)designed right the first time (more than 2 easily defendable&nbsp;spawn exits, perhaps look at ins_samawah_night Insurgent spawn, probably the least worst designed spawn area in Insurgency 1)<br />
<br />
(5)&nbsp;<b>Stability</b><br />
<br />
(a) Don't Insurgency 1 (read: fuck up) Insurgency 2 up. Insurgency 1 crashed every 10 minutes but players played it well into 2010 and 11. If Insurgency 2 starts crashing, Insurgency 1 veterans might not be so forgiving.<br />
<br />
(5)&nbsp;<b>Alpha testers</b>.<br />
<br />
(a) Seems like half of Insurgency 2 alpha testers (<a href="http://forums.newworldinteractive.com/showthread.php?86-Insurgency-2-Alpha-Test" rel="noreferrer" style="border: 0px; color: black; list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">http://forums.newworldinteractive.com/showthread.php?86-Insurgency-2-Alpha-Test</a>) are mentioned (read: reported as trolls, hackers, griefers, or incompetent scum) on this blog.<br />
<br />
(6)&nbsp;<b>Future</b>.<br />
<br />
Insurgency Mod was pretty popular, so&nbsp;<i>as long as you are not Alex "Endless" Kontinis</i>, it's gonna be hard to fuck Insurgency 2 up.<br />
<br />
Don't&nbsp;<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/03/red-orchestra-2-death-64-player-servers.html" rel="noreferrer" style="border: 0px; color: black; list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">reinvent the wheel</a>. Fix the code and maps, add new maps and weapons.&nbsp;<i>Profit</i>.</blockquote><br />

<br />
(Almost) constructive criticism:<br />
<br />
<b>Very bad</b>&nbsp;(some of these make Insurgency 2 look like a Source Engine COD clone):<br />
<br />
Red hit indicator? Don't need it. COD bullshit.<br />
Cardiograms? Don't need them. The definition of a bullshit HUD [see (2) above].<br />
Lasers? How about adding something new such as all those unplayable Insurgency 1 Humvee mounted MGs ( or IEDs?) instead of easy hacks such as lasers?<br />
Hole in a middle of a school? American school lockers in Ramadi? Realistic maps please [see (4) above] .<br />
MP40 with suppressor and Kobra (?) sights? Seriously? Do not want this COD WAW shit. Let the fpsbanana people take care of MP40s with supressors, lasers, modern sights, bayonets, and Iphones.<br />
MP5 bright white tracers? More COD bullshit.&nbsp;Do not want.<br />
<br />
<b>Bad</b>:<br />
<br />
Recoil seems low.<br />
Rate of fire seems low.<br />
Knife punches a hole in a wall. Knife doesn't beat wall AFAIK.<br />
M9 looks disproportionately large.<br />
<br />
<b>Good</b>:<br />
<br />
Nice RPG and grenade explosions.<br />
<strike style="border: 0px; list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">Running speed seems OK IMHO.</strike><br />
One stab in the ass = death.<br />
<br />
<b>Comments</b>:<br />
<br />
Youtube video money quote: "Insurgency? Look[s] more [like] a MW3ï»¿ clone. Where is the recoil? Where is the slow paced tactical shooter? It's fast and totally unrealistic. What a pity". [Industriallity]</blockquote></blockquote><br />
