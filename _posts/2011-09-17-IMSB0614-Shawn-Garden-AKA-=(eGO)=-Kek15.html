After EGO's incompetence regarding <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/08/ego-shitlist.html">Shawn Garden AKA &nbsp;=(eGO)= Kek15</a> was exposed thanks to A., EGO decided to password protect their Forum's profiles to avoid any further embarrassments. This move was without a doubt spearheaded by <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/05/shitty-admin-ego-digitaldj-aka-lt.html">=(eGO)= Digital "Dipshit" DJ</a>, EGO's Division Leader.<br />
