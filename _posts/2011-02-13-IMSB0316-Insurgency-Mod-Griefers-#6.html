Kendall Schmidt<br />
Los Angeles, California, United States  <br />
Kendall is the normal, understandable, leader. According to Kelly in Big Time Audition, Kendall is tall, blond, and all eyebrows. Gustavo chose Kendall as his singer in Big Time Audition, but Kendall talked Gustavo into letting him, James, Carlos, and Logan become a singing group. Kendall was supposed to be the clich√© bad boy of the band in the episode Big Time Bad Boy, but refused to succumb to a stereotype that didn't fit him (or any of the boys, for that matter). Out of the four, he is probably the most loyal, the most grounded, and the glue that holds the group together. The others also seem to look up to him in a way since they always go to him when they can't figure their way out of a problem themselves. Even though Logan is the resident genius, it's Kendall's ideas and schemes that usually solve their problems. Kendall is shown as a loyal friend, with good ideas and sarcasm. Kendall is always the one to get the band back together and in control. For example, in the episode Big Time Fever, Kendall is the only one in the band without "Hollywood Fever" because he stayed true to his roots, &amp; he is also the one who reminds the guys where their roots were when they had all changed from "Hollywood Fever" -- which they find out is actually just a term for home sickness.</blockquote><br />
