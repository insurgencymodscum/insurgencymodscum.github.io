<blockquote class="tr_bq">
So true. I do spend a lot of time in Europe and especially Britain. <br /><br />Sexual content in show and adverts is such an unremarkable feature, it would never even be mentioned. <br /><br />Just last night I was streaming an ITV show and one of the adverts for Nivea had a woman walking around naked from the back showing her fab skin I guess as a result of using Nivea. <br /><br />I doubt anybody even noticed when viewing it in prime time there. <br /><br />And while we're at it I dislike PBS buying authentic BBC and ITV shows then pixelating them like crazy all throughout in case, just in case, we might get a glimpse of breast. <br /><br />I also have noticed that a lot of British shows now are made with PBS money and written and filmed with an international audience in mind now that entertainment is international and no longer local to a country. <br /><br />This has cut down a lot on nudity. I've noticed that a lot in UK shows that used to regularly show nudity show up a month later on PBS or BBC America, with a lot less nudity.<br /><br />The uptight, prudish US tail has begun to wag at the more authentic to life international shows.<br /><br />I do wonder how many shows are cut at the production level in Britain because they won't be able to cater to the uptight US market they are aiming at. <br /><br />US viewers are a wide range of uptight and uncomfortable assholes like they are still fourteen year old and are on the school playground.<br /><br />One look at the, insert a popular forum, will bear out that theory. <br /><br />There is not much middle ground, no seeing nudity as normal, healthy and unremarkable. A country with puritanical background is polarized to these two extremes, if reading boards are any indication. <br /><br />With these standards, a lot of the great shows would never have been made if they had an international audience as its money making target. </blockquote>
