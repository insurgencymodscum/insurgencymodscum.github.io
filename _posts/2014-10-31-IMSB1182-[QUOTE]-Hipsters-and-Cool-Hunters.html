<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Cool-hunting has been around forever and is done by all kinds of people, not just hipsters. Were hipsters in at the start with glam rock? Disco? New Country?<br /><br />Yet all those things were "cool" (for a certain value of "cool") once upon a time.<br /><br />So hipsters are at best a subset of cool-hunters, and not a very interesting set, because they differ from other cool-hunters in their stupidity, insularity and arrogance. Many cool-hunters want to find the cool and share it with others. Hipsters want to find the cool and keep it to themselves, to the point of denying that anything that has become popular is cool any more.<br /><br />Another clue that hipsters have nothing interesting to say is their proclivity for using unconventional typography - such as eschewing capitalization - to draw attention away from the vacuity and falsehood of so much of what they say.<br /><br />Hipsterism is the practice of misdirection. Hipsters are lame people who have learned that attention is the scarcest human resource, so they can hide behind a few attention grabbing quirks. It saves them from having to do anything actually interesting, useful or productive.<br /><br />It's kind of sad, really, but the hate they get is well deserved, because they are socially useless people who are deliberating soaking up our precious, limited attention on completely pointless self aggrandizement.</blockquote>
