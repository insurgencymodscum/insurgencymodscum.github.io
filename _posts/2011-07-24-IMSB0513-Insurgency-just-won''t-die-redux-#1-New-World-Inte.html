<blockquote>InsurgencyÂ®: Remastered is a standalone online PC and Mac game that puts the player in strikingly realistic modern day conflict zones. The original Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was first released as a free mod on Steam back in 2007, and has since been downloaded by over a million people and formed its own small but dedicated gaming community. <br />
<br />
Newworld has assembled the original core team to make a remastered version of the game, focusing on the "Arab Spring" that is currently taking place in the Middle East. The game will be ported from the 2006 version of Source Engine to the most recent version of the engine that was used for Portal 2, featuring HD graphics with new and improved levels and gameplay. The Insurgency will return to Steam in 2012.</blockquote><br />

<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2011/07/insurgency-mod-source-code.html">Insurgency: Classic</a>: <i>dead</i><br />
Insurgency: Redeployment [<a href="http://www.teamredeployment.org/forums/">http://www.teamredeployment.org/forums/</a>]: <i>presumably in development with complete Insurgency:Classic code rewrite</i><br />
Insurgency: Remastered [what a shitty name IMHO]:&nbsp;<i>presumably in development, very little info, no forums</i><br />

<blockquote>As some of you may or may not know, I was the original producer of this mod. Over 3 years from first alpha to release I was the project lead. Unfortunately in college I gave the mod up for a bit, but after my education I tried to come back and take this thing to the next level and was blatantly and wholly shut down by the new development team I left it to - somewhat disappointing you may say.<br />
<br />
I was also the original producer of a little mod called Red Orchestra - heard of it? It eventually won the Make Something Unreal contest, a free Unreal 3 Engine License, and IGN Best First Person Shooter 2006. The multiplayer concept for Red Orchestra was my idea. From first alpha to first release I was the project lead.<br />
<br />
So what now?<br />
<br />
I've started a company called New World Interactive (or Newworld for short) and we've just licensed CryENGINE 3. Within my team are some of the original INS developers and many others.<br />
<br />
Now, some of you may be wondering what we plan on doing with our CE3 license - whether or not we're making an INSURGENCY sequel or not. I'm sorry to report that we are not making an INSURGENCY on CryENGINE 3. However, this does not mean an end to INSURGENCY. You see, we have the Source Code for the mod, and also registered the trademark in the US. If I raise enough money I'll license Source Engine, put a dedicated 3 man team on the project, replace all questionable code/content, use the community to help guide us with any new features we decide to implement, and release a commercial version of the game (with Libya scenario perhaps?) on Steam - INSURGENCY would live on.<br />
<br />
In the mean-time, we will continue working on our CryENGINE 3 game called Lethal Enterprise - a Steam, XBLA, PSN targeted drug-war themed FPS that I think many of you will enjoy. We will also continue to support the Insurgency Classic Project which is an open-source version of the original Beta 1 that anyone can modify willingly. And hey, if we end up making INS commercial maybe we'll pay you to keep your work and perhaps even offer you a job.<br />
