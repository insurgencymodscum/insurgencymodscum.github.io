Statement of Purpose<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been observing the hacker and hacktivist communities, at times very <br />
closely, for many years. The exact definition of “hacker” and “hacktivist” <br />
varies from author to author, so I shall make my interpretation of these words <br />
very clear. Let us define a “hacker” as someone who utilizes their knowledge of <br />
computers and of computer networks to make money via illegitimate means. Let us <br />
define a “hacktivist” as someone who utilizes their knowledge of computers and <br />
of computer networks to do justice when justice is not done by the state. I <br />
have found that these two communities are inextricably linked, yet remain <br />
completely separate entities. Many hackers double as hacktivists in their spare <br />
time, although most hacktivists do not fancy themselves hackers. <br />
<br />
Although hackers turned hacktivists have the very best of intentions, and their <br />
input and expertise is of great value to the hacktivist community, they have <br />
inadvertently suppressed the potential of the very community they are trying to <br />
aid. The get-in-get-the-goods-get-out methodology of the stolen credit card <br />
driven hacker community that has been transfered to the hacktivist community <br />
via ideological osmosis has tragically affixed blinders to it. It has caused <br />
the hacktivist community to think linearly and strive to do nothing more than <br />
to blindly infiltrate target organizations and immediately leak whatever data <br />
they happen to stumble across. This must change. Stealing and leaking data <br />
makes a point, but it is sometimes necessary to do more than just make a point, <br />
to inflict real, measurable damage. In certain, extreme cases an organization's <br />
disregard for human rights warrants its immediate and complete obliteration. <br />
<br />
In this essay, I will discuss a multitude of ideological, operational, and <br />
technical changes that ought to be made to the hacktivist community. These <br />
proposed changes have been derived from my personal observations. Some will <br />
find the ideas contained within this document to be the product of common <br />
sense. I have found these people to be few in number. If the community accepts <br />
my suggestions it will not only become more effective, but the risks associated <br />
with participating in it will be drastically lowered. My intent in writing this <br />
is not to aid criminals, but rather to aid people who wish to do battle with <br />
governments and corporations that have become criminals. If freedom is to <br />
remain on this earth, its people must be willing and able to take arms to <br />
defend it, both physical and digital.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personal Security<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound operational security is the foundation from which all effective <br />
cyber-offensives are launched. You should, at all times, put your own, personal <br />
security above the success of your operations and interests. The security <br />
precautions taken by most hacktivists I have met are mediocre at best, and <br />
needlessly so. Maintaining sound personal security is by no means difficult. It <br />
requires much caution but very little skill. I have devised a series of <br />
security precautions that hactivists should take and divided them up into six <br />
main categories: environmental, hardware, software, mental, pattern related, <br />
and archaeological. We shall examine each individually.<br />
<br />
(1) Environmental: <br />
<br />
There are but two places you can work: at home or in public. Some people insist <br />
that working at home is best and others insist that working in public is best. <br />
The proper working environment debate has been raging on in the hacker <br />
community for quite some time now, and has great relevance to the hacktivist <br />
community, as most governments view hackers and hacktivists as one in the same. <br />
Proponents of the “work in public” argument claim that by always working at a <br />
different public location, you significantly lower your chances of being <br />
apprehended. They argue that even if the authorities are able to trace many of <br />
the cyber-attacks you took part in back to the public places where you took <br />
part in them from, that does not bring them any closer to finding you. Most <br />
retail stores and coffee shops do not keep surveillance footage for more than a <br />
year at the most, and even if the authorities are able to get a photo of you <br />
from some security camera, that does not necessarily lead them directly to your <br />
front door, especially if you wore a hoody the entire time you where working <br />
and the camera never got a clear shot of your face. On the other hand, <br />
proponents of the “work at home” argument argue that the risk of being seen and <br />
reported, or merely recorded while working in a public place far outweighs the <br />
benefits of the significantly large increase in anonymity that working in <br />
public provides. Both sides have legitimate points, and I urge you to consider <br />
both of them.<br />
<br />
If you decide to work in public, the number one threat you face is other <br />
people. Numerous large criminal investigations have been solved using the <br />
observations of average everyday citizens who just happened to remember seeing <br />
something suspicious. If people sense that you are trying to hide something, <br />
they will watch you more closely than they would otherwise. It is important to <br />
always “keep your cool” as the old saying goes. Always try to sit in such a way <br />
that your screen is facing away from the majority of the people in the room you <br />
are sitting in. Corners are your friend. Try to blend in with the crowd. Dress <br />
in plain cloths. Draw no attention. If you are in a coffee shop, sip some <br />
coffee while you work. If you are in a burger joint, buy a burger. If you are <br />
in a library or book store, set a few books beside your laptop. Also, be very <br />
aware of security cameras, both inside the establishment you are working in as <br />
well as on the street near it. Being captured on film is alright as long as the <br />
camera can not see what is on your screen. Some store cameras are watched by <br />
actual people who will undoubtedly report you if they find out what you are <br />
doing. More and more governments are starting to place very high quality CCTV <br />
cameras on their streets to monitor their citizens, and these devices can be a <br />
problem if they are peering over your shoulder through a window you are sitting <br />
beside. When working in public, it is possible that you may have to confront a <br />
law enforcement officer face to face. Law enforcement officers can smell <br />
uneasiness from a mile away, and if you look like you are up to no good it is <br />
possible that a cop will come and talk to you. Always have some sort of cover <br />
story made up before you leave home to explain why you are where you are. If <br />
you are forced to confront a law enforcement officer you should be able to talk <br />
your way out of the situation. <br />
<br />
If you decide to work at home, the number one threat you face is your own ego. <br />
Just because you are at home does not mean that your working environment is <br />
secure. Be aware of windows in close proximity to your computer as well as your <br />
security-illiterate or gossipy family members. Security issues in relation to <br />
network configuration begin to come into play when you work at home. If your <br />
computer were to somehow get compromised while you are working at home, <br />
perhaps by your government, it would be nearly impossible for the person or <br />
group of people rummaging around inside of your system to get your actual IP <br />
address (provided that you adhere to the software security guidelines that we <br />
will discuss later). However, if your wi-fi password (or the name of your <br />
printer, or the name of another computer on the network) contains your actual <br />
last name and part of your address, tracking you down becomes very easy. A lot <br />
of people name their network devices and structure their network passwords in <br />
this way.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that if an attacker that has infiltrated your computer <br />
notices other machines on your network they can pivot to them (infect them with <br />
malware using your computer as a spring board of sorts) and use them to get <br />
your IP address. A lot of Internet enabled household devices have cameras on <br />
them (your smart TV, your Xbox, and your high tech baby monitor to name a few) <br />
and said cameras can potentially be leveraged against you. It is in your best <br />
interest to not have any other machines running on your home network while you <br />
are working. Also, change your wi-fi password every once in awhile and make <br />
sure that the password on the administrative interface of your router is <br />
something other than the out-of-the-box default. If your computer gets <br />
compromised, logging into your router using username “admin” and password <br />
“admin” is elementary for a moderately skilled attacker. Most modern routers <br />
list their WAN IP address on their control panels.<br />
<br />
Regardless of where you decide to work, be aware of mirrors and glass picture <br />
frames near your workplace. In the right light, both of these items have the <br />
potential to reflect crystal clear images of your screen to onlookers across <br />
the room. In addition to this, understand that modern cell phones are your <br />
worst enemy. Not only are they always going to be the weakest link in your <br />
security setup, but if they are somehow compromised they are equipped with a <br />
camera and microphone. Recent studies suggest that it is possible for smart <br />
phones to listen to the high pitched noise your CPU makes and deduce your PGP <br />
private key. Furthermore, the metadata collected by your phone coupled with <br />
pattern analysis techniques could potentially allow your government to link <br />
your real life and online personas together after some time. We will discuss <br />
this in depth later. Leave your phones at home and if possible keep all phones, <br />
yours or otherwise, far away from your computer. Other portable devices such as <br />
iPods and tablets potentially pose the same risk that phones do and should be <br />
treated the same.<br />
<br />
(2) Hardware:<br />
<br />
Modern computers come equipped with microphones, speakers (which can be used as <br />
microphones under the right circumstances), and cameras. All of these features <br />
can potentially be leveraged to identify you if your computer is compromised. <br />
To mitigate these risks, these features should be physically removed. Your <br />
computer's microphone and speakers should be ripped out of it, but you should <br />
not rip out your web cam, as it will alter the outward appearance of your <br />
computer and potentially draw attention to you. Instead, open your computer's <br />
screen and snip the wires that connect to your web cam. Wrap the ends of the <br />
wires in electrical tape so sparks do not jump in between them. If you must <br />
listen to an audio file while working, use headphones. Only keep your <br />
headphones plugged into your computer when you are using them. The computer you <br />
use for your hacktivist activities also should not contain a hard drive, as <br />
they are unnecessary for our purposes. <br />
<br />
(3) Software: <br />
<br />
Always use a TOR enabled Linux live system when working. At the present moment, <br />
Tails (The Amnesiac Incognito Live System) is by far the best live distribution <br />
for your purposes. You can read more about TOR at www.torproject.org and you <br />
can read more about acquiring, setting up, and using Tails at tails.boum.org. <br />
The Tails operating system lives on a USB flash drive. Every time you start up <br />
your computer, you must first insert your Tails flash drive into it. The Tails <br />
website will guide you through making said flash drive. Tails will <br />
automatically direct all of your outgoing traffic into the TOR network in an <br />
effort to hide your IP address. If you use Tails you will be completely <br />
anonymous and be able to work with impunity provided that:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You keep your Tails USB up to date. New versions of the Tails <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operating system are released every few months. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You do not login into your “real world” accounts while using Tails. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not check your Twitter feed while you are working.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You do not use Tails to create an account with an alias that you have <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; used before. If you have been “0pwn” for the past seven years, now <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; is a good time to stop being 0pwn.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You do not alter Tails' default security settings. They are the way <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; they are for a reason. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You do not use Tails to create an online account with a password that <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; you have used before. Doing this only makes deanonymizing you easier.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You do not install and use random packages that “look cool”; they <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; could be miscellaneous. Only use packages and scripts that you trust. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tails is not bullet proof. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you decide to set a sudo password when starting up Tails, make <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; sure that it is very strong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You stay conscious of metadata analysis techniques. We will discuss <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; these later.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You switch exit nodes every ten to fifteen minutes. This can be done <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; by double clicking the little green onion in the upper right hand <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; corner of your Tails desktop and hitting the “Use a New Identity” <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; button.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You follow the communication guidelines laid out later in this <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br />
<br />
More information can be found on the Tails warning page: https://tails.boum.org/<br />
doc/about/warning/index.en.html. Be aware that it is very easy for your ISP <br />
(which is probably working closely with your government) to tell that you are <br />
using both TOR and Tails. It is probably in your best interest to use something <br />
called “TOR bridge mode”. You can read more about how to configure Tails to <br />
use TOR bridges here: https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/<br />
bridge_mode/index.en.html. <br />
<br />
Tails is unique in that it has a special feature that wipes your computer's <br />
memory before it shuts down. This is done in order to mitigate risks associated <br />
with the dreaded “cold boot attack” (a forensics method in which a suspects RAM <br />
is ripped out of his or her computer and then thrown into a vat of liquid <br />
nitrogen to preserve its contents for later analysis). This feature is also <br />
triggered if you pull your Tails flash drive out of your computer while you are <br />
working. If while you are working you ever feel that the authorities are about <br />
to move in on you, even if you have a seemingly irrational gut feeling, yank <br />
your Tails flash drive out of your computer. Tails also has a feature that <br />
allows it to disguises itself as a Windows desktop. Using this feature in <br />
public will reduce your risk of capture significantly. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
(4) Mental: <br />
<br />
A skilled attacker is well disciplined and knows that he must keep his actions <br />
and skills a secret in order to remain safe from harm. Do not flaunt the fact <br />
that you are dissatisfied with your government, a foreign government, or a <br />
particular corporation. Do not attend protests. Do not publicly advertise the <br />
fact that you have an above average aptitude for computer security offensive or <br />
otherwise. And whatever you do, do not tell anyone, even someone you think you <br />
can trust, that you are planning to launch an organized cyber-attack on any <br />
organization, big or small. If you draw attention to yourself no amount of <br />
security precautions will keep you safe. Keep your “real” life mentally <br />
isolated from your “hacktivist” life. One lapse in operational security could <br />
end you. <br />
<br />
Be alert and focused. Remain mentally strong. Come to terms with the illegality <br />
of your actions and what will happen to you if you are apprehended. As a wise <br />
man once said, “A warrior considers himself already dead, so there is nothing <br />
to lose. The worst has already happened to him, therefore he's clear and calm; <br />
judging him by his acts or by his words, one would never suspect that he has <br />
witnessed everything.” It is perfectly acceptable to be paranoid, but do not <br />
let that paranoia consume you and slow your work. Even if you are extremely <br />
cautious and follow this document's advice to the letter, you still may be <br />
hunted down and incarcerated, tortured, or killed. Some countries do not take <br />
kindly to hacktivists. It is best that you be honest with yourself from the <br />
beginning. In order to operate effectively you must be able to think clearly <br />
and see the world as it actually is. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
(5) Pattern Related:<br />
<br />
When your online persona is active your real life persona ceases to exist, and <br />
an observant adversary can use this to their advantage. If your ISP, bank, and <br />
mobile phone provider are “cooperating” with your government and allowing them <br />
to browse through all of their records (a fair assumption in this day and age) <br />
then, eventually, they will be able to deduce your real identity by comparing <br />
everyone's data to information about your online persona. If the government <br />
looks backs on all of the records they have collected in the past year and <br />
notice that you never make a credit card purchase, watch Netflix, go on your <br />
Facebook, Google, or Twitter account, or change your physical location while <br />
1337Hax0r64 is online on some anti-government forum on the deep web, they will <br />
assume that you are 1337Hax0r64. Even information about your home network's<br />
bandwidth usage can give away your real identity. <br />
<br />
Luckily, performing the type of metadata analysis attack described above takes <br />
time, usually many months. It is very important that you change aliases often, <br />
preferably every three or four months. Shed your old names like a snake sheds <br />
its skin. When you do change your online name, make sure your new identity <br />
can not be tied back to your old one. <br />
<br />
DO NOT not launch cyber-attacks from your own computer. Launch attacks only <br />
from hacked servers, servers purchased with washed bitcoins, or free shell <br />
accounts. Certain types of cyber-attacks produce a large amount of traffic over <br />
a short amount of time. If the bandwidth usage of your home network spikes at <br />
the same instant that a government or corporate server is attacked, the time it <br />
takes to deanonymize you is reduced significantly. This is especially true if <br />
you launch multiple attacks on multiple occasions. Launching attacks in this <br />
way can be mentally exhausting. Configuring a new attack server with your tool <br />
set every time your old attack server is banned (an inevitable occurrence) can <br />
be a tedious task indeed. I personally recommend creating a bash script to <br />
automatically install your favorite tools to make this transition process <br />
easier. Most hackers and offensive security professionals use under thirty <br />
non-standard tools to do their job, so configuring a new server with everything <br />
you need should not take very long if you know what you are doing. Consider <br />
equipping your server with TOR and a VNC server (for tools that require GUIs <br />
such as most popular intercepting proxies) as well. <br />
<br />
(6) Archaeological:<br />
<br />
You must insure that there is no forensics evidence of your actions, digital or <br />
otherwise. If the government breaks into your house and rummages through your <br />
things, they should find nothing interesting. Make sure that you never make any <br />
physical notes pertaining to your hacktivist activities. Never keep any <br />
computer files pertaining to your hacktivist activities in your home. Keep all <br />
of your compromising files, notes, scripts, and unusual attack tools (the ones <br />
that can not be installed with apt-get or the like), and stolen information in <br />
the cloud. It is recommended that you keep all of your files backed up on <br />
multiple free cloud storage providers so that in the event that one of the <br />
providers bans your account you still have all of your data. Do not name your <br />
cloud accounts in such a way that they can be connected back to your online <br />
persona. Never, under any circumstances, mention the names or locations of your <br />
cloud accounts to the people you work with.&nbsp; Always hit the “Use New Identity” <br />
button on your TOR control panel after accessing your cloud storage solutions. <br />
Every time you shed your old alias, shed your old cloud accounts. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Security of Communications<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority of hacktivists I have met communicate via public IRC. Using IRC is <br />
fine for meeting other hacktivists, but as soon as you muster a team of other <br />
hacktivists who wish to attack the same target as you, move to another more <br />
secure form of communication. Some means of communication are more secure than <br />
others, but completely secure communication does not exist. The following <br />
guidelines are meant to work in conjunction with the personal security <br />
guidelines that where discussed in the previous section. If proper personal <br />
security measures are implemented effectively, compromised communication will <br />
result in operational failure at worst and not complete deanonymization. Since <br />
operational failure may very well set you and your cause back several months, <br />
it is in your best interest to attempt to communicate securely:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remember that any of the people you meet on the clearnet, deep web,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; or public IRC channels who claim to be on your side could actually <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; be government agents trying to sabotage your operations.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If possible, communicate mainly via&nbsp; privacy friendly email accounts <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (not Gmail, Yahoo, AT&amp;T, etc.) and encrypt all of your messages with <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; PGP. When a cyber-attack is being carried out it is often necessary <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to be able to communicate with your accomplices instantaneously. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Since encrypting, sending, receiving, and decrypting messages by hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; takes time, using PGP in time sensitive situations like this is not <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; feasible. If you have to confer in an IM environment, use a program <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; like TorChat that uses its own form of asymmetric encryption to send <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and receive messages instantly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use strong passwords for all of your online accounts. The best way to <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; make a strong password is to pick eight or nine random words and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; string them together. Passwords like this are easy to remember but <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; hard to guess. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Never give away any personal information (such as country, interests, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; hobbies, health, etc.) or give insight into your feelings or <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; emotions. Your fellow hacktivists are not your friends and should <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; never be talked to as such. Giving away this sort of information will <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; make tracking you easier. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you receive messages, do not retain them, even if they are <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; encrypted. Read them, make note of any hard to remember details <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (like long server passwords for example), and then delete them. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Having a mile long digital paper trail can not lead to anything good. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In some cases deleted messages on email serves can be recovered via <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; computer forensics, but deleting messages quickly may reduce the odds <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; that they can be.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When typing messages, do so in a word processor on your computer. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Never write your message inside of a communication program (such as <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; an online email client, forum PM box, etc.). People have been known <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to accidentally send unencrypted messages before. The effects of such <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; an error can be devastating. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you find yourself writing large swaths of text intended for public <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; release (like essays or manifestos) use a tool like Anonymouth to <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; obscure your writing style. Your writing style is as unique as a <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; finger print and can be used to identify you. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Never, under any circumstances, execute a file on your computer or on <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; your server that has been given to you by a fellow hacktivist. You <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; should never run into a situation where doing this is necessary. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Do not disclose information about your involvement in previous <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; hacktivist operations to people who where not also part of the same <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; operation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If one of the people that you are working with gets captured, assume <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; that the people who have captured them know everything that they do. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Philosophy of Attacking<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The hacktivist community, like every community, has its own unique set of <br />
philosophical musings, taboos, and dogmas. While I do not advocate the severe <br />
alteration of the principles and philosophies on which the community was built, <br />
I do wish to point out a number of flaws in certain aspects of their <br />
composition. These flaws serve only to hold back the community and should be <br />
openly discussed. <br />
<br />
(1) When hacktivists target an organization, their goal is more often than not <br />
to force said organization to stop functioning permanently, or at least for the <br />
longest time possible, in an effort to stall unjust actions from being carried <br />
out or to seek retribution for unjust actions done in the past. Leaking <br />
databases, DoXing influential individuals, defacing websites, and launching <br />
massive DDoS campaigns, four of the modern hacktivist community's favorite <br />
activities, accomplish this goal - to an extent. Infiltrating a target <br />
organization and sowing discord within its ranks is magnitudes more effective <br />
than leaking credit card numbers or putting a CEO's social security number on <br />
Pastebin, yet it is rarely, if ever, considered to be a viable course of <br />
action. Subtly and silently fostering suspicion and distrust inside of your <br />
target will have a longer lasting impact than simply pointing out that its <br />
security policy has some weak points.<br />
<br />
(2) Hacktivists crave publicity, yet they are the most effective when they <br />
operate undetected. Stay hidden. Although it may seem tempting at times, do not <br />
destroy large amounts of information on your target's computers or servers. <br />
Doing so will announce your arrival inside of your target's network rather <br />
loudly. Flashy, public displays of power have no place in the hacktivist <br />
community. Just because you are hiding behind TOR does not mean that you should <br />
not make an effort to cover your tracks. Conceal your attack not to mask your <br />
identity, but to convince your target that no attack was carried out in the <br />
first place. <br />
<br />
(3) Once your hacktivist collective has decided to attack an organization, <br />
strike fast and strike hard. Overwhelm your target. A well disciplined and well <br />
organized team of attackers can penetrate most networks within a few hours. <br />
Far too often I have seen hacktivist collectives declare all out war on someone <br />
and then attack them slowly and gain entry into their network days, sometimes <br />
even weeks later. By attacking slowly, you give your target time to react and <br />
strengthen their defenses. Detecting an attack from a large hacktivist <br />
collective is a trivial task, but as history has shown detecting the presence <br />
of one inside of a network, especially a large network, can be tricky.<br />
<br />
(4) Cyber-attacks seldom go as planned. If you are attempting to do anything <br />
that involves the coordination of more than two people, keep this in mind. It <br />
is not uncommon for tools to stop working in the middle of an attack. It is not <br />
uncommon for reverse shells to die unexpectedly. It is not uncommon for <br />
seemingly simple actions to take hours to perform. You must be ready to think <br />
on your feet and quickly adjust your attack plan to accommodate the ever <br />
changing conditions within the network you are attacking. Predefined <br />
contingency plans are mostly useless.<br />
<br />
(5) Remember that no system is impenetrable. On more than one occasion I have <br />
seen hacktivists give up on trying to infiltrate a target network because their <br />
Nessus scan did not yield any useful results. As a hacktivist, you are not <br />
bound by the typical constraints of a pentester. If you can not successfully <br />
attack a website, try attacking its hosting provider. Try attacking the <br />
administrator's email account. Try going after random social accounts belonging <br />
to the administrator's family. Try planting iframes in websites you suspect the <br />
administrator frequents in an effort to infect him. If you cause extensive <br />
collateral damage, who cares? It is not your problem. Sometimes the ends <br />
justify the means. Be creative. <br />
<br />
(6) Many hacktivists possess unrealistic, self-constructed mental images of the <br />
ideal cyber-attack. In the majority of these movie-induced delusions, the ideal <br />
attack utilizes numerous 0days, an arsenal of home made tools, and highly <br />
advanced, unimaginably complex network intrusion techniques. In reality, this <br />
type of thinking is incredibly dangerous and causes some hacktivists to attempt <br />
to perform convoluted, elaborate attacks to gain the respect of their peers. <br />
When breaking into highly secured networks, such attacks only draw unnecessary <br />
attention. The best attacks are the ones that work. They are usually simple and <br />
take little time to execute. Using sqlmap to spawn a shell on your target's <br />
server by exploiting a flaw in their website's search feature is a viable if <br />
not ideal attack. It allows you to access the inside of your target's network. <br />
Exploiting a vulnerable FTP daemon on one of your target's servers using public <br />
exploit code is a viable if not ideal attack. It allows you to access the <br />
inside of your target's network. Using Metasploit in conjunction with a fresh <br />
Gmail account to launch a phishing campaign against your target's employees is <br />
a viable if not ideal attack. It allows you to access the inside of your <br />
target's network. The media hates it when hacktivists use open source software <br />
to do their work. Whenever a hacker or hacktivist is arrested for doing <br />
something that involved using “someone else's” tools, they are publicly <br />
shammed. “Anyone could have done that” they say. “He's just an unskilled script <br />
kiddie” they say. Claiming that someone is less of a hacker solely because they <br />
partially depend on someone else's code borders on absurd. It amounts to <br />
claiming that Picasso is a bad artist because he did not carve his own brushes, <br />
synthesize his own paints, and weave his own canvas. Do not shy away from using <br />
open source tools and publicly available information to accomplish your goals. <br />
Hacking is an art, and nmap is your brush.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Organization and Formation<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the hacker and hacktivist groups I have observed are unorganized and <br />
undisciplined. They claim to perform actions as a collective, yet when it comes <br />
time to actually launch an attack they attempt to infiltrate their targets as <br />
individuals, each member launching attacks of their own without making the <br />
faintest attempt to coordinate their actions with others. Here I shall describe <br />
a schema that could be easily adopted by any hacktivist collective to allow it <br />
to facilitate highly coordinated attacks involving large numbers of attackers <br />
with great ease. It will be presented as a series of steps.<br />
<br />
Step One: Organize yourselves into multiple small groups. These groups shall be <br />
referred to as strike teams. The ideal strike team is composed of three parts <br />
attack specialists, two parts social engineering specialists. Attack <br />
specialists should at least be able to identify and competently exploit <br />
potential vulnerabilities in websites and be able to exploit vulnerable or <br />
misconfigured services. Social engineering specialists should have at least <br />
some real world experience before participating in a strike team. Attack <br />
specialists should only concern themselves with launching attacks and social <br />
engineering specialists should only concern themselves with social engineering. <br />
Well-defined roles are the key to a strike team's success. This configuration <br />
will often create an abundance of social engineering specialists, and that is <br />
perfectly acceptable. Having the capability to immediately launch multiple well <br />
planned social engineering campaigns is crucial. The size of a strike team <br />
will be determined by the skill of its members. Highly skilled individuals <br />
should work in very small strike teams (five member teams are acceptable) <br />
whereas unskilled individuals should work in larger strike teams (up to a few <br />
dozen). The organization of strike teams should be coordinated as a collective. <br />
No one person should be given the authority to sort people themselves. Strike <br />
teams should function as “sub collectives” and be autonomous. Hacktivist <br />
collectives are composed of people around the world, most of whom can not be <br />
online all the time. This means that all strike teams should set themselves up <br />
knowing that their members will pop on and offline and that it is possible new <br />
members will have to be annexed at a later time. <br />
<br />
Step Two: Within each strike team, agree upon a stratagem; a broad, realistic, <br />
nonspecific plan of action that aims to accomplishes one, very specific goal. <br />
Strike teams should only execute one stratagem at a time. Multiple strike teams <br />
within the same hacktivist collective can execute different stratagems at the <br />
same time in an effort to accomplish some sort of final goal (perhaps to <br />
destabilize an organization or to acquire trade secrets). The next section of <br />
this essay is devoted solely to exploring the concept of stratagems and how to <br />
best form and use them. Strike teams should be allowed to do what they want, <br />
but their initial stratagem should be approved by the collective so that no two <br />
strike teams attempt to do the same thing at the same time. <br />
<br />
Step Three: As a strike team, map your target's attack surface. If multiple <br />
strike teams are all attacking the same network, they should share information <br />
very closely in this step. It is very possible that multiple strike teams <br />
working together to accomplish the same goal could actually be attacking <br />
different networks, in which case mapping should be done within individual <br />
strike teams. Each member of a given strike team should attempt to map the <br />
target network themselves, and then members should compare information. It is <br />
very unlikely that anything will be overlooked by every single member of the <br />
team. <br />
<br />
Step Four: Divide your target network up into manageable chunks and assign <br />
certain individuals within your team to each one of those chunks. Efficient <br />
devision of labor is key to launching speedy attacks. Here is an example <br />
involving a network composed of four servers (two SQL servers, a DNS server, <br />
and a web server hosting a feature rich corporate site) and a strike team <br />
composed of six attack specialists and four social engineering specialists:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist attack the SQL and DNS servers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist attack the website's multistage user <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; registration mechanism and login mechanism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist attack the contact and session management <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; mechanism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist attack any forms not assigned to other <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; attack specialists as well as any other potentially exploitable <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; scripts, pages, or mechanisms.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist and two social engineering specialists <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; attempt to launch some sort of phishing champaign against the <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; company's employees. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have one attack specialist and two social engineering specialists <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; attempt to convince the company's hosting provider that they are the <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; rightful owners of the company's four servers and have been locked <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; out of their email account. <br />
<br />
Step Five: Drill yourselves. This step is optional but highly recommended. <br />
Procure a server with a large amount of RAM and multiple processors. Have one <br />
member of your strike team set up a virtual network on it that, to the best of <br />
your knowledge, mimics the network you are planning to attack. This one team <br />
member should not participate in the drills themselves, and they should not <br />
give other team members details pertaining to the virtual network. If you are <br />
planning on attacking a large cooperation, set up the virtual network like a <br />
large cooperate network with a labyrinth of firewalls, routers, switches, and <br />
domain controllers. If you are planning on attacking a small cooperation or <br />
home business, set up your network accordingly. You should never have to <br />
visualize more than 12 workstations, even if your team is doing a complex <br />
pivoting exercise. As a group, attempt to break into your virtual network and <br />
execute your stratagem. The virtual network should be deliberately <br />
misconfigured so that there is a way for your team to infiltrate it and <br />
accomplish their simulated goal, but the misconfigurations should be extremely <br />
subtle. The team should have to work very hard to find them. Run multiple <br />
drills. After each drill, the misconfigurations in the network, and potentially <br />
the layout of the network itself, should be altered to force your team to <br />
attack it in a different way or to exercise a different skill. The purpose of <br />
these drills are two fold. Firstly, they allow your team members to get <br />
accustomed to working together. Secondly, they will prepare your team for the <br />
day when they actually go up against your real target network.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Step Six: Execute your stratagem on your target network. Your strike team <br />
should attack methodically and silently. Every member should know what they <br />
need to do and how they need to do it. No mistakes should be made. Every tool <br />
you use should be well honed and function flawlessly. Not a second should be <br />
wasted. Use time to your advantage. Your target organization will be the most <br />
unprepared for an attack in the middle of the night when all of its IT staff <br />
are at home sound asleep. If your stratagem calls for being embedded in your <br />
target network for a long period of time, tread very lightly once you <br />
infiltrate it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interlocking Stratagems in Theory <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this section I will give multiple examples of stratagems that an actual <br />
strike team could make use of. You should combine multiple stratagems to <br />
accomplish your ultimate goal. Individual stratagems are like pieces of a <br />
jigsaw puzzle, and are intended to be pieced together. A strike team should <br />
execute multiple stratagems in succession, possibly in cooperation with other <br />
strike teams in an effort to accomplish a common goal. This section is not <br />
intended to be a play book. I encourage you to build off of my stratagems or, <br />
better yet, devise your own. Some stratagems are:<br />
<br />
(1) Collect information on individuals within the target organization. Mount a <br />
phishing campaign against the organization and gain access to as many <br />
workstations as possible. Once you have breached its network, do not pivot. <br />
Attempt to locate any useful information on the workstations you have <br />
compromised, and then remain in the network for as long as possible doing <br />
nothing more than idly gathering intelligence. <br />
<br />
(2) Take complete or partial control over the target organization's main means <br />
of communication (usually email). Review a few of their messages and learn how <br />
they are structured and formatted. Then, send a number of blatantly false <br />
messages to one or more members of the organization using the credentials of <br />
another member of the organization. Multiple false messages should be sent over <br />
some period of time. When members of the organization begin to receive false <br />
messages from their colleagues, distrust will begin to take root. <br />
<br />
(3) Take complete or partial control over the target organization's main means <br />
of communication (usually email). Review a few of their messages and learn how <br />
they are structured and formatted. Then, devise some way to intercept and <br />
inspect or modify messages in transit within the target organization <br />
(essentially, perform a man in the middle attack). Every once in awhile, alter <br />
a message in a subtle but disruptive way. Perhaps change a date or a time so <br />
certain individuals do not arrive at their meetings on time or do not arrive at <br />
all. Once you have reason to believe that your modifications have taken their <br />
toll (i.e. the person you targeted missed their meeting), undo the changes you <br />
made to the message you intercepted so upon audit it appears as though the <br />
message was never tampered with. Doing this is usually hard to detect and will <br />
slowly cause the target organization to destabilize itself as tensions between <br />
individuals within it begin to rise and their employees begin to question their <br />
own sanity.<br />
<br />
(4) Take complete or partial control over the target organization's main means <br />
of communication (usually email). Review a few of their messages and learn how <br />
they are structured and formatted. Use the credentials of a high ranking <br />
individual within the target organization to distribute a message that appears <br />
to be from them that claims a terrible tragedy has occurred that warrants an <br />
immediate, brash, resource intensive response from the rest of the <br />
organization. You will most likely not be able to pull this off more than once. <br />
This stratagem works especially well against militant groups with poorly <br />
defined command structures but has other applications as well. <br />
<br />
(5) Once inside of the target organization's network, acquire a small amount of <br />
classified data intended for the eyes of high ranking personnel only. <br />
Strategically plant the data on the computer of one or more lower ranking <br />
individuals. Make it look like an espionage attempt. If many key individuals <br />
within the target organization are accused of trying to siphon out its secrets, <br />
it will be forced to suspend a large portion of its operations while an <br />
investigation is done. <br />
<br />
(6) Use a DDoS attack to disrupt the target organization's communications for a <br />
short period of time when they are most in need of it. For a corporation, this <br />
could be during an important international Skype call. For a government, this <br />
could be immediately following a devastating attack from an insurgency group. <br />
Doing this will cause panic, which will make the target organization <br />
temporarily more susceptible to other kinds of attacks. <br />
<br />
(7) Pose as a legitimate company selling legitimate software and befriend the <br />
target organization. Create a piece of software with a very hard to detect <br />
security flaw in it and sell it to them. The flaw could be as simple as a <br />
poorly implemented encryption library or as complex as an insecure multistage <br />
parsing algorithm. It must be incredibly subtle. So subtle that if it is <br />
detected you will be able to write it off as unintentional. It should be <br />
plausibly deniable. Once the target organization installs the vulnerable <br />
software on their machines, leverage it to perform targeted attacks on key <br />
individuals within it. Do not use it to infect entire subnets, as that will <br />
draw to much attention.<br />
<br />
(8) Locate a small software provider your target organization already does <br />
business with and infiltrate their network by using other stratagems. Modify <br />
their source code slightly so that their software becomes vulnerable to remote <br />
attack. Do not modify just any code you come across, study the software <br />
provider's development process and target code that has already been checked <br />
for bugs and is days away from being released to customers.&nbsp; When the target <br />
organization installs the latest version of software from the company that you <br />
have infiltrated, they will become vulnerable. Leverage this vulnerability to&nbsp; <br />
perform targeted attacks on key individuals within the target organization. Do <br />
not use it to infect entire subnets, as that will draw to much attention.<br />
<br />
(9) Locate a small software provider your target organization already does <br />
business with and infiltrate their network by using other stratagems. Most <br />
software companies offer rewards to security researchers who find <br />
vulnerabilities in their products. Determine how reported vulnerabilities are <br />
managed by the company you have infiltrated and devise a way to monitor them <br />
in real time. As soon as a security researcher reports a major vulnerability <br />
in a product your target organization uses, use it to perform targeted attacks <br />
on key individuals within it. Do not use it to infect entire subnets, as that <br />
will draw to much attention.<br />
<br />
(10) Using other stratagems, infiltrate the computers of a number of influential <br />
individuals within the target organization. Monitor their activity constantly <br />
and closely. If possible, listen to them through their computer's microphone. <br />
When you believe that one of them has left their computer, undo things they <br />
have just done. Delete the last sentence they wrote. Hit the back button on <br />
their web browser. Close the program they just opened. Over time, this will <br />
lead them to question their sanity. <br />
<br />
(11) Using other stratagems, infiltrate the computers of a number of influential <br />
individuals within the target organization. Most modern governments and <br />
corporations are at least partially corrupt. Find evidence of this corruption <br />
and use it to compel one or more of these influential individuals to aid your <br />
cause. If you are unable to find any evidence of corruption, do not be afraid <br />
to bluff. If you make a mysterious window pop up on, say, a CFO's computer that <br />
alludes to some sort of dirty secret, it is very possible that the CFO will <br />
assume that the hacker who caused the widow to appear knows something about <br />
them that they actually do not. A lot of powerful people have skeletons in the <br />
closet. The media has instilled a fear of hackers into the general populace, <br />
and this fear can be used to your advantage. Most normal people, upon being <br />
confronted by a hacker that has gained complete control of their computer, will <br />
be inclined to believe plausible sounding white lies. Having an “inside man” <br />
within your target organization can be extremely useful. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interlocking Stratagems in Practice<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this section I shell present an example of a plausible situation that could <br />
warrant the involvement of hacktivists and a corresponding attack loosely built <br />
upon the stratagems from the last section. I have tried to make the situation <br />
realistic, but it is very likely that if you use my writing to plan and execute <br />
your own attack it will play out nothing like the attack depicted below. Most <br />
actual attacks are far more complex than the one presented here. The purpose <br />
of this example is to demonstrate the way in which multiple strike teams should <br />
work together. Notice how at all times each team has one or more specific <br />
goals. <br />
<br />
Situation: A hacktivist collective has decided to attack the terrorist <br />
organization Bina Al-ar-mal after they captured and executed a tourist in <br />
Syria. Bina Al-ar-mal is believed to consist of over 40,000 people, has <br />
hundreds of public Twitter feeds and Facebook accounts, and runs a small <br />
terrorist news site hosted on a Russian server. It has three known leaders, who <br />
we shall refer to as Head Terrorist 1, Head Terrorist 2, and Head Terrorist 3. <br />
Twenty-seven hacktivists have joined the effort. They have been split into <br />
three teams: team 1 consists of five of the most highly skilled hacktivists, <br />
team 2 consists of seven moderately skilled hacktivists, and team 3 consists of <br />
fifteen amateur hacktivists. <br />
<br />
Time Line:<br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 1) Team 1 is initially tasked by the collective with infiltrating <br />
as many terrorist Twitter and Facebook accounts as possible. The team starts <br />
enumerating the accounts immediately. They decide that no drill will be <br />
executed, as breaking into Facebook and Twitter accounts is a trivial task. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 1) Team 2 is initially tasked by the collective with infiltrating <br />
the web hosting provider hosting the terrorist group's website. They begin <br />
reconnaissance.<br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 1) Team 3 is initially tasked by the collective with attacking <br />
Bina Al-ar-mal's website directly. They begin to map the website.<br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 2) Team 1 finishes enumerating the terrorist Facebook and Twitter <br />
accounts. They begin attempting to break into them. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 2) Team 3 finishes mapping Bina Al-ar-mal's website and begins to <br />
attack. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 3) Team 1 has breached a few terrorist Facebook and Twitter <br />
accounts. After examining their contents they determine that the terrorists <br />
are using SpookyMail email service to communicate off of social media. A few <br />
terrorist email accounts are identified and the team begins to try to break <br />
into those as well. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 3) Team 3 gains read/write access to a limited portion of the <br />
server Bina Al-ar-mal's website is hosted on. The other teams are alerted. <br />
They set up a simple php based IP logger script to capture the IP addresses of <br />
Bina Al-ar-mal members attempting to check their organization's news feed. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 6) Team 2's reconnaissance ends. They have located the web hosting <br />
provider and gathered information on said provider's website and servers. They <br />
begin attacking them. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 7) Team 1 breaches their first few terrorist email accounts. <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 9) Team 2 locates a vulnerability in the the terrorist's web <br />
hosting provider's website. They are not able to fully compromise any of their <br />
servers, but they are able to get a list of customer names, domain names, and <br />
billing addresses by exploiting a flaw in the website's shopping cart feature. <br />
Upon inspecting the list, they discover that the person paying Bina Al-ar-mal's <br />
hosting bill has a British billing address. The other teams are alerted and <br />
Scotland Yard is notified of the terrorist threat immediately.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
(Day 1, Hour 23) Team 1 is able to get Head Terrorist 1's email address off of <br />
the “contact” pane of one of the hacked terrorist email accounts. They make <br />
ready for a spear phishing attack against him, but decide to wait some time to <br />
launch it, as it is currently the middle of the night where Head Terrorist 1 is <br />
believed to be. <br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 3) Team 3 has gathered over seven thousand IP addresses of people <br />
viewing Bina Al-ar-mal's news feed and tries to attack them all using known <br />
router vulnerabilities. When all is said and done they have infected <br />
thirty-seven routers and forty-six workstations. They determine that <br />
thirty-four of these work stations belong to active members of Bina Al-ar-mal. <br />
They observe these workstations passively, hoping to gather information. The <br />
other two teams are briefed on their success. <br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 8) Team 1 launched a spear phishing attack against Head Terrorist <br />
1 using the hacked email account of another terrorist.<br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 9) Team 1's spear phishing attack against Head Terrorist 1 is a <br />
success. They now have full control over his Windows XP laptop and inform the <br />
other two teams of their success. After searching the laptop's hard drive and <br />
downloading a half gigabyte of confidential documents and IM logs, the team <br />
decides to plant a PDF of the Christian Bible on it along with some real <br />
looking fake papers from the CIA. After gleaning Head Terrorist 2's and Head <br />
Terrorist 3's email addresses from the stolen IM logs, the team sends them both <br />
emails from the hacked email account of a lower level terrorist claiming that <br />
Head Terrorist 1 is dirty. <br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 9) Team 3 decides to take the sensitive information stolen from <br />
Head Terrorist 1's computer stolen by Team 1 along with other fake CIA <br />
documents and place it on all thirty-four of the terrorist workstations they <br />
control. They use a hacked email account belonging to an uninvolved terrorist <br />
to inform Head Terrorist 2 and Head Terrorist 3 that Head Terrorist 1 is a <br />
traitor an he has at least thirty-four moles inside of their organization, all <br />
of whom they mention by name. <br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 10) Head Terrorist 1's laptop is searched by security forces under <br />
the control of Terrorist 2. Head Terrorist 1 is determined to be part of the <br />
CIA and is placed into a cell to be used as leverage against the United States. <br />
<br />
(Day 2, Hour 17) Head Terrorist 2 and Head Terrorist 3 raid all thirty-four of <br />
the suspected moles and find the planted documents. They begin to interrogate <br />
all thirty-four of them in order to find out how deep the CIA has penetrated <br />
their organization. None of them know anything but most of them make up real <br />
sounding false information to make the interrogations end. <br />
<br />
(Day 3, Hour 3) Team 1 determines that most remaining Facebook and Twitter <br />
accounts can not be breached. Several team members leave and a few stick around <br />
to try and finish off the remaining accounts. <br />
<br />
(Day 6, Hour 17) Scotland Yard arrests the person allegedly paying for Bina <br />
Al-ar-mal's web hosting. It is later determined that the person is actually <br />
part of a London-based Bina Al-ar-mal cell. <br />
<br />
(Day 6, hour 20) Team 2 destroys Bina Al-ar-mal's web site after catching word <br />
of the Scotland Yard raid.<br />
<br />
End Result: One of three head terrorists is being held by their own <br />
organization as a traitor and thirty-four unrelated terrorists are being held <br />
by their own organization and brutally interrogated about actions they did not <br />
commit. One terrorist is in the custody of the Scotland Yard, and a British <br />
terror cell has been exposed. Bina Al-ar-mal's entire communication network is <br />
compromised (but they do not know that yet), and their website has been taken <br />
offline permanently. All members of Bina Al-ar-mal are now becoming <br />
increasingly suspicious of their fellow members and the hacktivist collective <br />
is now in a position to launch further attacks on Bina Al-ar-mal (using the <br />
