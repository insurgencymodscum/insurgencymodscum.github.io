<blockquote>Due to inactivity on both of our servers. Our INS servers are closed. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the new INS will be out next year and we can revisit the idea of opening up another INS server [see <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/search/label/Insurgency%202">Insurgency 2</a>]. <br />
<br />
Keep you posted.</blockquote><br />
