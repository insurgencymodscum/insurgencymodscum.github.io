Update: Both ShareX and OBS are not able to stop and resume recording :(.<br />
<br />
You want to video record two things on your screen at the same time. Use multiple instances of Open Broadcaster Software or ShareX (both are open source).<br />
<br />
RunOBS.bat<br />
start /b %CD%\OBS.exe -portable -multi<br />
<br />
RunShareX.bat<br />
start /b %CD%\sharex.exe -multi -portable<br />
<br />
BTW, do not use XSplit, it looks like a scam.
