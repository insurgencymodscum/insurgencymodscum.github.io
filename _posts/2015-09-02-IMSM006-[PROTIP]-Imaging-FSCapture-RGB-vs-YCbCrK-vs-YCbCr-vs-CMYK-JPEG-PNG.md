Note: the following is possibly wrong.

---

Videos (VirtualDub): use `24 bit RGB (888)`.

---

Images:

`RGB` - contains "redundant" information.

`CMYK` - used for printing.

`YCbCrK` - same as YCbCr but something something to do with CMYK.

`YCbCr` - **USE THIS ONE!** Smaller file size than RGB.
