Flies stick to shit, dipshit admins stick to EGO. This EGO admin has been abusing his rights and appears to be colluding with a hacker. <br />

What was the determining factor in this admin being "shitty"?<br />

This post proves nothing. Where is your evidence? I feel like you got banned and are just moaning about it here. Where's this supposed friend who hacks? That might be a better post to make here, rather than your unsupported complaints.<br />

I'm one of the Division Leaders in charge of the FPS:X Division that controls and maintains the Insurgency servers for eGO. I would very much like to be made aware of any wrong doing on the part of administrators that I'm responsible for. If anyone has any proof that DigitalDJ is acting outside of his boundaries, please send it to me on the website or submit a dropbox post on the forums that will be viewable only to the Division Leaders and Council members.<br />

I should also say that if people are worried about transparency I will also look over evidence posted here.<br />

In order for me to ban someone they have to be breaking rules pretty bad bc usually I dont even bother playing INS. Your argument is invalid.<br />

Lol so you think I was the one that decided to password the forums? The whole jumping to conclusions to make one look back thing is played out guys.<br />

Lol, I think it would be funny because everything you guys think you have on me is just fabricated. Until I see a single stitch of proof from the day I was accused of me being a "shitty" admin, I might believe it. But until you muster up a screen shot of something, anything, showing im a bad admin solidifies everything this site is about. Pure assumptions.<br />
