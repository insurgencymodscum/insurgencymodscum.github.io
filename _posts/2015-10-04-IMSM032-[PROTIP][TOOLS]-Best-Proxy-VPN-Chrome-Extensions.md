### SkyZip ###

`Data compression` extension. German satellite internet company. Probably the most legitimate one on this list.. In options `Mode` refers to data compression (`None`, `Moderate`, `Medium`, `High Delay`, `Extreme`).

```
skyZIP is a German service for customers using satellite communications. However, it works well with terrestrial connections too. Data is routed through NYNEX proxy servers with an average bandwidth savings of around 50% (claimed). There are 5 compression levels ranging from none to extreme. High gives a good performance to savings ratio.

skyZIP converts images to webp format, cleanses webpages and uses gzip compression. It also uses an optimized http protocol and multiplexes requests resulting in higher throughput. As an additional bonus, it encrypts (TLS 1.2) all data and you can open blocked content.
```

```
Proxy extensions are commonplace but SkyZIP specifically advertises itself as an acceleration and compression proxy designed to save bandwidth. It is from German satellite company Nynex and was created to offer their customers bandwidth savings, but can be used by anyone. Pages are sent to the Nynex servers where HTTP pages are compressed. Images are converted to WebP and CSS, Javascript and HTML is Gzipped. Data is encrypted with TLS 1.2 and sent via HTTP/2.

skyzip for firefox

Once installed the extension functions slightly different depending on your browser. In Firefox the options are available from the icon, they are to enable/disable SkyZIP globally and select the rate of compression. The higher the compression mode you choose, the more data savings you should get at the expense of page load speed. The Chrome version has its own settings window where you can additionally choose to exclude specific IPs and provide authentication (presumably for Nynex customers only).
