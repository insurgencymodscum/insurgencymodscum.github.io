(a.k.a. <b>Jesse Leigh</b>) started his career as a musician at first DJing around Washington and by getting into digital audio creation in Seattle WA in hopes of spreading the word to America about the great electric sounds coming out of Europe and express himself through his music.<br />
He delivered that with “Zepelin” and “Mind Bomb” from his first official album “OMGME” in 2008 which had rave reviews from his peers and fans.<br />
Now on his second album “All Out Of Drive” due to be released sometime in 2009 he hopes to explore even more areas of sound and kick things up a few notches. </blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>http://steamcommunity.com/groups/KEPT<br />

Whitelist Submissions</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>Why does this team exist?<br />
<br />
Our goal is to enforce the whitelist and make it have meaning in order to keep whitelist using servers clean and free of maps that would other wise puncture a hole in the entire reason behind even having a whitelist system.<br />
<br />
We hold testing sessions to test each and every one of the maps on the whitelist and scour it clean of offending maps.<br />
<br />
We don't have an official 24/7 server (at least not yet) up and running constantly, but we are working on getting one and we have plenty of members that allow us to use their own servers for kept testing.<br />
<br />
keep in mind, TWI still has final word. We have influence as players but if TWI disagrees with our final verdict about a map than we have no choice but to comply because we are just players like everyone else.<br />
<br />
Our steam group will be used to organize actual testing sessions (via announcements and group chat) and this forum is for posting map reviews.<br />
<br />
We also test maps awaiting whitelisting approval.<br />
<br />
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO GET RID OF:<br />
<br />
1. Maps with exploits, obviously. <br />
Anywhere you can get to that allows for an unfair advantage in your favor against specimens. There should never be a time in KF when you are completely out of harms way.<br />
<br />
2. Maps that are camper happy <br />
Maps that "funnel" zombies into one big line or swarm that you can just sit and spam bullets and nades at. these maps are too easy and should be de-whitelisted.<br />
<br />
3. Maps that are just plain too easy <br />
lets face it, KF is a hard game and should stay that way. everytime a retardedly easy map pops up and is whitelisted, a billion servers pop up that only run that map. we want this to stop.<br />
that's not to say that we won't allow maps with more casual gameplay, but when normal starts playing like beginner and hard starts playing like normal, then you have a broken map that needs to be revised.<br />
<br />
4. Grinding maps<br />
Sort of the same thing as number one but more obvious. If a map lets you sit in a corner being healed by a medic while farming fleshpounds or heal each other while a hurt trigger damages you and you uber level your medic, that map is a grinder map and definitely infringes on whitelist policy.<br />
<br />
In addition to what was said above, I'd like to point out that it is also our goal to discover, record and report all abuses, no matter how we find said information.<br />
<br />
Tips on how to find popular exploits:<br />
<br />
- Search in the server list to find popular maps. Chances are, if it is an EXTREMELY popular custom map, it's more likely to have exploits that people are leveling on.<br />
<br />
- Join servers that are running suspicious maps to see if people are using exploits<br />
<br />
- Follow players around. sometimes they will always head happily to their favorite spot and you can snap an easy screenshot.</blockquote><hr style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;" /><blockquote>http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791430876075<br />
