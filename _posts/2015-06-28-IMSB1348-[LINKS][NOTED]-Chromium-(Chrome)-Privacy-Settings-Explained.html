How to Disable Privacy Sensitive Features in Google Chrome</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
I’ve often heard it said that, “nothing is free,” but if we’re talking about browsers, then that old adage is doubly true …</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
It’s likely that one of the core reasons for creating Google Chrome in the first place was a desire to use it to collect user data. While Google already has services in place that allow the company to do so, a web browser would provide Google with additional data that its services are not able to collect.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
It comes as no surprise that Chrome communicates a lot with Google during regular browsing sessions, and while the connection attempts serve a purpose — like checking websites you visit against a phishing and malware database — it also provides Google with information at the same time.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
One needs to distinguish between preferences that are controllable by the user, and those that are not. The following guide looks at user controllable preferences only.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Google Chrome privacy settings</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
google-chrome-privacy</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
all privacy settings</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
1. Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
If a connection to a website cannot be made for whatever reason, Chrome may retrieve alternative web pages similar to the one you are trying to reach. &nbsp;To achieve that goal, the website you are trying to open is submitted to Google.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Use a web service to help resolve navigational errors”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
2. Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This feature will auto-complete addresses or searches that you start to type in Chrome’s omnibar. It will show related web searches, match addresses from your browsing history, and also from popular websites.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The browser sends information about what you type to the default search engine of the browser. If that is Google, the information will be logged.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
3. Predict network actions to improve page load performance</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Instead of looking up the IP address of a web page on user action, Chrome will do so in advance by predicting the user’s next action. This speeds up the connection process if the prediction was correct, but may waste some bandwidth if it was not.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
For this to work, Chrome will analyze all links on a web page and fetch IP addresses for those that it predicts you may visit.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Predict network actions to improve page load performance”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
4. Enable phishing and malware protection</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Websites that you open in Chrome are checked against a malware and phishing database before they are loaded. If a web page is a match, information are submitted to Google to determine whether it is a risky site.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Enable phishing and malware protection”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
5. Use a web service to help resolve spelling errors</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
If enabled, text that you type will be submitted to Google servers for spell checking purposes.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Use a web service to help resolve spelling errors”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
6. Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This will transfer information about how the browser is used and information about crashes to Google. This includes information about browser preferences, clicks, and memory usage among other things.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Automatically send usage statistics at the bottom of the page”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
7. Hyperlink Auditing</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Disables the sending of hyperlink audit pings which can be used to track users.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Load chrome://flags/#disable-hyperlink-auditing</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Disable underneath it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
8. Search</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Switch from Google to a privacy search engine such as Startpage or DuckDuckGo.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Load chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Locate Search.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Select Manage search engines.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Select a different search engine and click make default.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
9. Sync</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
chrome sync</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
synchronization preferences</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
While synchronization sounds like a great idea if you are running Chrome on multiple devices, it needs to be noted that the data is stored on Google servers.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
You can choose to encrypt all data with a custom password that is different from your Google account password, or disable sync altogether to store no information on Google servers.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on “Advanced sync settings”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Select “Choose what to sync at the top”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck all items that you do not want to save (all if you want).</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click ok.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Alternatively, switch to “Encrypt all synced data with your own sync passphrase”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type a password that you want to use.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
10. Third-party cookies</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
cookies third party</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
third-party cookies</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Cookies can either be set by the “domain” you are currently on, e.g. ghacks.net, or by a third party domain that is used for some functionality on the site. This is often used by advertising scripts to track users.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Content settings</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Check “Block third-party cookies and site data”</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Note: Doing so may render some services unusable. Add those domains to the list of exceptions.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
11. First-party cookies</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
You can keep cookies set by the domains you connect to for as long as you do not clear them or they do not expire, or only for the session. If you want that, change the setting under cookies from “allow local data to be set (recommended)” to “keep local data only until I quit my browser”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Note: This removes session cookies among others, which means that you will have to sign in to web services again as you will be logged out automatically when the cookies get deleted.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
12. Translation service</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Google may offer to translate a web page you are visiting if it detects that it is published in a language that is different from the default system language or a language that you have added to the browser.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Uncheck “Offer to translate pages that aren’t in a language I read”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
13. Location tracking</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
location-tracking</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Chrome location tracking</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Location tracking can be useful in certain situations, as websites and services may provide you with custom information or improved data when you allow that.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
They can look up your location to automatically display offers near you for example. It is usually possible to enter a location manually on the other hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Content settings.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Switch from “ask me when a site tries to track my physical location (recommended)” to “Do not allow any site to track my physical location”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
You can add exceptions for sites that you want to allow.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
14. Extensions</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
chrome privacy manager</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
While you can go through all preference and options menus manually, you can instead use a browser extension such as Privacy Manager instead to handle most of these changes.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
15. Chromium</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
If you want much of what make Google Chrome without many of the Google-only features that the company added to it, then you may want to try Chromium. While it may share some features, others may not be included.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
16. Set plugins to click to activate (thanks Akbarri)</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Most plugins run by default in Chrome when they get picked up by the browser, which means that websites can use what they have to offer as well without any user interference or notification.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
If you do not like that, change them to click to play instead so that you are always asked before plugin contents are run on websites. You can add exceptions for sites that you trust.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Type chrome://settings/.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Show advanced settings at the bottom of the page.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Click on Content settings.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Switch “Plug-ins” from “Run Automatically (recommended)” to “Click to play”.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
You can add exceptions for sites that you want to allow.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Note: Google will block most plugins by default come 2014. The most popular ones will be set to click to play automatically first, but eventually, all plugins won’t be available anymore in the browser.</blockquote>
