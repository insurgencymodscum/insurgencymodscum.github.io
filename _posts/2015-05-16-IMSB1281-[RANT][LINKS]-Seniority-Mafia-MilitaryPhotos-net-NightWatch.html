<br />
Recently MilitaryPhotos.net, a forum with a self-explanotry name, died after about 10 years of operation.<br />
<br />
Less recently INSMODSCUM registered an account there and very soon was offered the following unsolicited advice: something like "lurk on the forum before posting".<br />
<br />
INSMODSCUM has been lurking on that forum since 2003 or 2004, and has an account from that time to prove it.<br />
<br />
So fuck you, all the "Senior Members" who give unsolicited advice consisting of "lurking". INSMODSCUM call this "Seniority Mafia". It seems every large forum has one, even WikiPedia, although in case of WikiPedia it's usually called a "cabal" rather than "mafia".<br />
<br />
Insurgency Mod Scum readers will recall that "seniority" is a frequent tactic of cheaters. Once these cheaters are accepted into a group, one can literally describe it as a "mafia". The group will stand by its own, even with VAC bans and other obvious evidence. They will protect and defend their collective reputation.<br />
<br />
It is the same thing with trolls, low information and noise generators on Internet forums. Once the rats get in on the ground floor, they are very hard to kill.<br />
<br />
Another information source that recently died is NightWatch.<br />
