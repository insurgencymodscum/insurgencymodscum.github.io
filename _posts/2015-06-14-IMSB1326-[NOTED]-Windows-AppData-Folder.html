What is the AppData folder?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Applies to Windows 8.1, Windows RT 8.1</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The AppData folder contains app settings, files, and data specific to the apps on your PC. The folder is hidden by default in File Explorer, and has three hidden sub-folders: Local, LocalLow, and Roaming.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Roaming. This folder (%appdata%) contains data that can move with your user profile from PC to PC—like when you’re on a domain—because this data has the ability to sync with a server. For example, if you sign in to a different PC on a domain, your web browser favorites or bookmarks will be available.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Local. This folder (%localappdata%) contains data that can't move with your user profile. This data is typically specific to a PC or too large to sync with a server. For example, web browsers usually store their temporary files here.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
LocalLow. This folder (%appdata%/…/locallow) contains data that can't move, but also has a lower level of access. For example, if you're running a web browser in a protected or safe mode, the app will only be able access data from the LocalLow folder.</blockquote>
