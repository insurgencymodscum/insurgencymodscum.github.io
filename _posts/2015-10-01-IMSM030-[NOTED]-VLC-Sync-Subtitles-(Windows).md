There is a much more easy way to do this via the advance synchronisation functionality of VLC

Detect (“hear and see”) that subtitles are out of sync
Press Shift + H when you hear a sentence that you will be able to easily recognize
Press Shift + J when you read the same sentence in the subtitle
Press Shift + K to correct the sync
```

TLDR:

```
`Shift + H`: begin sync
`Shift + J`: when you see subtitles catch up
`Shift + K`: to apply delay and synchronize subtitles
```

OR:

```
`H` / `G` adjust **subtitles** *forward* / *backward*
`J` / `K` adjust **audio** *forward* / *backward*
```
