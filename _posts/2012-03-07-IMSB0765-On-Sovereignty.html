<blockquote>Sovereignty? Please, there is not a sovereign nation left in the western world. Its a fool's paradise to think we have sovereignty, democracy or personal freedoms.<br />
<br />
It's a joke, the narrative of politics. We are owned (registered at birth), penned (nationalism), trained (schooling and cultural myths) and work for subsistence (wage slaves), and we beg (vote) for mercy from our leaders (plutocracy pimps parading in politics). </blockquote>
