Requirements: 

- List all Git repositories on the hard disk and show which repos have changed (background refresh).
- Not Electron-based

**TLDR: Use SmartGit. (Shitty) alternative: GitEye (Eclipse-based). SmartGit even includes JRE, GitEye doesn't. Also not portable without hacking.**

# Less Shit #

  ## GitG ##
  Slow. Very fucking slow! Hipsterish UI. Only one repo at a time. By: "GNOME".

  ## Tower ##
  On first start, allows to scan hard disk for Git repos, then hides this option. Shitty UI. Only one repo at a time.

# Shit #

  ## GitAhead ##
  1.1.2: only one repo at a time! QT-based. (Also JavaScript-required, shitty website!)
  Non-free (latest version).

  ## GitExtensions ##
  GitExtensions-2.50.00-SetupComplete.msi
  Does not properly uninstall: changes editor (from the default "vim") in ".gitconfig"!
  GitExtensions-2.49.03-Mono
  Only one repo at a time.

  ## GitHub Desktop ##
  No original portable version. Hack exists, but doesn't work. Shit tool anyway.

  ## Git-Cola ##
  Broken. Doesn't start. Python based.

  ## SourceTree ##
  Broken. Requires "registration". Hipster-ish UI (with broken "registration" page).

  ## TortoiseGit ##
  Useless. "TortoiseGit" is a shell extension... Impossible to uninstall without rebooting.

# Shit / Electron-Based #

## GitKraken ##
## Aurees (freemium) ##

## "Cycligent Git Tool" ##
Broken, amateur website. Fine...
"A Cross Platform Electron Angular 2 App that works with Windows, Mac, and Linux."
CycligentGitToolSetup-0.5.2-win32-ia32
SMH! One-click-no-confirmation install... Non-free. Brogrammer-hipster shit. Go fuck yourself (with your MacBook).
~~~

# Shit / Mac-Only #

## GitX ##
## GitBox (shitty website) ##
