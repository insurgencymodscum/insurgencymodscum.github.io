Insurgency is a worthy successor to Insurgency Mod AKA Insurgency Modern Infantry Combat, except several, mostly graphics related problems: <br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>Death Messages. </i>By default death messages are off, which means almost all populated servers are more vulnerable to cheaters and griefers.<br />
<br />
<i>Cheat CVARs.</i> Yes, INSMODSCUM is complaining about excessive blacklisting of CVARS.<br />
<br />
<i>HDR.</i> It seems it is very hard to turn off HDR.<br />
<br />
<i>DXLEVEL/mat_dxlevel.</i> It seems it's impossible to force a lower dxlevel.<br />
<br />
<br /></blockquote>
Except for death messages, the above are only problems for users of shitty laptops or players who actually prefer shitty graphics.
