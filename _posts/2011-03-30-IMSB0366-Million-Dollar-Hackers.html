<blockquote>Accusations of cheating against me<br />
Hello everyone, I play on the firefight server as the player "Ben". I'm sure many of you recognize me since I play this game way too much hehe. Anyways, many people have accused me of cheating and I could honestly careless. However, I really enjoy playing this game and especially on eGO's server. In order to prevent any kind of careless ban, I am open to give anyone demos of me playing.<br />
<br />
I never record demos, but if people feel a need to see me play to determine if I cheat or not I would be happy to provide them with game footage. I only do this since there are many players on the server who say I cheat and then say they will be sending the demos to admins. Which is good, because if you have any experience with finding players that use wallhacks or aimbots you should easily see that I do not use either.<br />
<br />
There also exists a blog http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/ that lists me as a cheater and many other players on Firefight as cheaters (including eGO members). This blog doesn't provide any proof on these alleged cheaters, but that doesn't stop it's author from posting any personal information they can get a hold of including the accused steamid so that they can be banned by any willing server admin.<br />
<br />
Players that play with me can tell you that I love to play this game from my teamwork and enthusiam while playing. I get along well with most players, and I'm not one to start an argument. I hope you all take this as a message just to clear my name and to continue killing insurgents with all of you.<br />
