<blockquote>When you go into politics, what kind of device do they ram up there to rip - your ability to feel embarrassment - out?<br />
<br />
The "device" is a large wad of cash and cheques which is shoved repeatedly into either the subjects hand or pockets. Side effects of this treatment include: a deranged mindset, inability to distinguish fantasy from reality, and voluminous stools emerging from both digestive orifices.</blockquote>
