<blockquote>The truly sad part is that the bulk of modern society is walking… no, running headfirst into this very future and still refers to those of us pointing a cautious finger forward as “nutjobs”.<br />
<br />
Was it my reading too much dystopian fiction in my formative years? Am I really just a nut job? Is the rest of society truly THAT far gone?<br />
<br />
I hesitate to whip out derogatory terms like “sheeple” and their ilk, as I don’t actually see myself as better or worse than the millions of misguided souls whose lives are being digitally cataloged just like mine.<br />
<br />
At some point in the last few years, I finally got it through my thick skull that most people are good <i><b>actors</b></i>. They may not genuinely grasp an idea, but they know how to pretend they do, so that they don’t come off a fool. At least until one attempts a coherent conversation about the subject matter at hand.<br />
<br />
And that’s when it hit me, all these years of training people <b><i>not&nbsp;</i></b>to think, but instead to mark little circles and finish all of their homework problems and follow the bells around the building all day long. The Pavlovian society built atop these indoctrination and training systems has habitually lobotomized the mass mind.<br />
<br />
Only t<i>he freaks</i>, <i>the non-conformists</i>, still gather outside the Great Walls of Social Acceptance, and now they’re able to track them there too. And before much longer, the Hunter Killers will pin them down and eliminate their problematic existence entirely.<br />
<br />
The triumph of the emerging global state is nearly complete. And I know why Philip K. Dick and so many other dystopian authors receded into drug use and isolation. Ours is <i><b>not</b></i> a pretty future.<br />
<br />
Moving to a centuries old, semi remote farmstead may forestall the arrival of the Hunter Killers for a few years, since guarding the great walled cities will be the main focus of their deployment, but I’m under no illusion that distance confers immunity from the darkness slowly spreading across the planet.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I will be able to live out my lifespan, without too much harassment if I avoid any overt activism beyond the one on one aid we already provide to others looking for a way out of the industrial maze. Perhaps not...</blockquote>
