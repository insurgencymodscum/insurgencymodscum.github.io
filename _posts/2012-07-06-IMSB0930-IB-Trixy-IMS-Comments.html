Why not create a cool server on the INS mod and stop wasting your time bitching about all of the assholes doing a worse job of it? <b>[So they can continue abusing players with impunity?]</b> I would just like to see more reputable and actionable servers running on the server list like it used to be 2 years ago. And, just to be fair, some people, like me, join servers to be a part of the 'good' of the game and to help <b>[INSMODSCUM joins servers to have fun. If somebody is preventing that by engaging in micspamming, teamkilling, cheating, griefing, etc., they will be posted here. If admins repeatedly -&nbsp;</b><b>intentionally or not -&nbsp;</b><b>ignore cheaters or griefers, they will be posted here.]</b> Not everyone has an 'evil plan' to fuck up a good thing <b>[Good people left Insurgency a while back]</b>. Not all of us are the scum you think we may be. Trixy<br />
