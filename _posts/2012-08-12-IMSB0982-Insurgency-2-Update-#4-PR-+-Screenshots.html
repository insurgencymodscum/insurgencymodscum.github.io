<blockquote>DENVER, COLORADO | AUG 11, 2012<br />
<br />
Welcome to our new Website...<br />
<br />
A lot has happened over the past year, and we’ve been pretty quiet about it. We always wanted this project to be somewhat of a "sleeper" – one of those games that pops out of nowhere that everyone starts talking about. Exposing ourselves this early in development is something we had never planned to do, but here we are looking for money to keep this project alive and make it as great as it has the potential to be.<br />
<br />
The videos we are demonstrating to the public and what we’ll be showing at PAX are from from a pretty stable Alpha build that has many of the fundamental gameplay mechanics implemented, but still has many tweaks and improvements to come. We have built this game on the best and most proven multiplayer game engine, and you can expect an announcement about this in the near future.<br />
<br />
We have 10 map layouts we've been messing around with, but wanted to focus on only a few of our favorites. The screenshots below are taken from Mogadishu, one of the maps we are focusing on right now. Check it out:<br />
<br />
We recently released a gameplay video which got posted as an exclusive on Rock, Paper Shotgun and later on GameSpot's YouTube channel. As mentioned, this game is in Alpha and we are currently taking feedback very seriously. <b>We encourage anyone who has an opinion to post it on our forums, because we actually read the them</b>. We are constantly modifying gameplay to better suit what our community wants to play.<br />
<br />
Insurgency 2 is a lot of fun. We have a lot of work ahead of us and recognize it, however we find ourselves sometimes playing our game for hours when we only set out to play a couple of rounds – development time lost, perspective gained. We really want to keep this gameplay as alive and continually evolving, with the plan to expand the experience to include as many real-world Insurgency scenarios as possible.<br />
<br />
With your help, we can make this thing a reality, so please visit our Kickstarter page. We really would appreciate your support by pledging and sharing the link with a couple of your friends!<br />

Here’s the Kickstarter Link again.<br />
