This is where things like uBlock Protector come in. These run their own scripts and make use of a blocking list to essentially "defuse" detectors into not working, or make them report back that everything is fine. This defeats the majority of adblock detectors, but they sometimes need be customised for individual sites, hence why even with both, you still might get anti-adblocked.
