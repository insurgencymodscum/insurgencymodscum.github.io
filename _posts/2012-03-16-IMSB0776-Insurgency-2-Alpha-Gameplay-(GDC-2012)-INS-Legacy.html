Map has similarities to <a href="http://s1.gameme.com/img/maps/heatmaps/insmod_ins_ramadi_640.jpg">ins_ramadi</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Good</b>:<br />
<br />
<i>No crashes!</i><br />
<br />
<b>Bad</b>:<br />
<br />
<i>Deathcam AKA killcam (OK if OFF by default).</i><br />
<br />
<i>Suppression indicators (too COD-esque).</i><br />
<br />
<i>Tracers (too COD-esque).</i><br />
<br />
NWI please don't <i>'Red Orchesta 2'</i> Insurgency 2, i.e. COD it up. [IMS2].<br />

<blockquote>Two years after I visited Valve at GDC, Jeremy returned to San Francisco with a prototype of INS 2.<br />
<br />
Following my visit, I started a campaign against the leadership who brought stagnation to Insurgency. I can safely declare victory for our cause. However, it was the continual efforts of Jeremy and his team at New World who have set up shop in Denver that brought this victory. I simply acted as a catalyst to initiate the campaign so they could reclaim their rightful intellectual property. They deserve full credit for waging a successful strategy to pursue their passion for Insurgency and game development. Victory stems from their work.<br />
<br />
This proves how the former leadership was an absolute failure. If they had a game and competence, as they claimed, it would have been continued to be developed and subsequently released by now.</blockquote>
