Whatever happened to Insurgency Mod? (note "jaboo224")<br />

<blockquote>What happened is that after Beta 2.0 me and a bunch of other devs (chris, stepp, skybex, just to name a few) got jobs in the industry and left the mod roughly at the same time. Jeremy, the project director on Beta 1.0 also left because of his studies. Some other people then took over the administration and that's when INS started to die. They had good intentions but the drive to make it happen and the talent just wasn't there anymore. We tried real hard to recruit new people but it was a pain the ass to make them stick around. Some would either leave after 2 or 3 months and other never did anything at all. [Minos]<br />

I guess that's more or less the same of what happened to other mods... the talented modders either got jobs in the industry or turned indies.

Some other veterans from the old Insurgency core team are also about to join us. [Steppenwolf]</blockquote><br />
