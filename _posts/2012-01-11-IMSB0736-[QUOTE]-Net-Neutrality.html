<blockquote>People should consider seizing utility services via Eminent Domain and turning them into co-ops.<br />
<br />
The laws in the US actually require open access to wire services because they were run on public land with tax subsidies. Unfortunately, the law didn't specify all means so companies put in fiber trunks and then refused to share access because fiber is not wire. It's time to take it all away from them.<br />
<br />
The Internet is the railroad and roads of the next century. You can get gigabit fiber to the house in other countries but the US is being crippled by the copyright racket.</blockquote>
