What a stupid fucking website.

You don't need fucking JavaScript for a link to an *EXE* file FFS!

What a stupid fucking name too BTW. If `Spoon` - their previous name for their software wasn't **too** retarded for you, they came up with `Turbo`. 

If the *infinity-sized* amount of stupidity is not obvious, `Turbo` is too generic and will pollute your search results with useless shit, if - or when - you have an problem with `Turbo`.
