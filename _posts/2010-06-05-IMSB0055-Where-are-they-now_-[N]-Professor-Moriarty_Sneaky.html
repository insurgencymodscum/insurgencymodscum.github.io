What happened after [N] Professor Moriarty AKA Tom Quinn and his buddy from San Francisco - Sneaky Asian Man AKA Xempt got banned from a well known Insurgency server?<br />
<br />
Sneaky Asian Man AKA Xempt got VAC banned (<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/twest/">http://steamcommunity.com/id/twest/</a>).<br />
<br />
And both [N] Professor Moriarty and Sneaky Asian Man seems to have ran out of unbanned STEAM accounts and came up with a brilliant idea of starting their own server - "Tactical Squad Gameplay Organization" [holy shit, what an awesome name, Edge Gamers Organization must be jealous!]<br />
<br />
...but of course failed.<br />

Edit:<br />
Perhaps Racer should stop associating with EVERYTHING related to Insurgency including cheating. The energy on that guy....<br />
