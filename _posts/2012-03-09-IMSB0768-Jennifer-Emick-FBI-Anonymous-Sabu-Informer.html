<blockquote>Jennifer Emick has now been confirmed beyond a doubt to be FakeGreggHoush/Asherah/Backtra­ce Security - which is to say that the FBI has indeed been receiving tips on their investigation into Anonymous from a deranged Wiccan whose﻿ current opposition to Anonymous stems from emotional difficulties that have been described at length elsewhere, and who has made a number of demonstrably erroneous and sometimes contradictory assertions in the course of this whole affair.</blockquote><br />
Disillusioned [delusional] ex-Anonymous first outed Sabu last year.<br />

DEFCON 19: Anonymous Cyber War <br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw-QpOCp0SY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw-QpOCp0SY</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Speakers: Hubris Strategic Operations, Backtrace Security | a5h3r4h Director of Psychological Operations<br />
<br />
This talk will educate listeners on best practices for safety and privacy on the Internet.It aims to demonstrate the improbability of staying anonymous while engaging in group or social activities on the internet, and especially while engaging in criminal activities as a group.<br />
<br />
This talk will reveal how Hubris, A5h3r4h, and Backtrace security staged a cyber war against anonymous, using Anonymous' own methods, and how key operatives in anonymous were exposed, scattered and neutralized. In short, how a handful of bored social engineers with no material resources used trolling, social engineering, and the magic of Google to derail an army of out of control btards with a dose of virtual Ritalin.<br />
<br />
We will also provide an explanation of how different organizations (and even non-organizations) have their own "signature" beliefs and behaviors and how they can be used against them. <br />
