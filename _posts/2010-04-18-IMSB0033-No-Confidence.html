If you monitor the official Insmod forums you might have noticed some of the usual forum trolls (especially a few of the Australians players) changed their signatures to say something about "no confidence". The "no confidence" refers to a post made by Andrew Spearin AKA Argyll one of the original developers of Insmod and&nbsp;<strike>his&nbsp;</strike>the "No Confidence" steam community group here: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/insnoconfidence">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/insnoconfidence</a> [started by defunkt and Caught off Guard]. In addition to Argyll's blog at <a href="http://deniedltd.com//?http://inslegacy.wordpress.com/">http://inslegacy.wordpress.com/</a> Jeremy Blum another original developer of Insurgency as of April 14, 2010 now seems to control <a href="http://deniedltd.com//?http://insurgencymod.net/">http://insurgencymod.net/</a> and the corresponding twitter account <a href="http://deniedltd.com//?http://twitter.com/insurgencygame">http://twitter.com/insurgencygame</a>.<br />

In addition to Argyll's "no confidence" campaign Jeremy also filed a petition which is now closed to new signatures at <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/insdev/petition.html">http://www.petitiononline.com/insdev/petition.html</a> which as of today has 250 signatures to which Alex Kontinis AKA Endless responded to here <a href="http://forums.insmod.org/index.php?showtopic=22418">http://forums.insmod.org/index.php?showtopic=22418</a> of course trying to be all lawery-like. There is also an alleged statement by Pablo Dopico AKA "Dr. Spielmann"  another Insurgency developer who appears to have recently resigned: <a href="http://deniedltd.com//?http://inslegacy.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/revolution/">http://inslegacy.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/revolution/</a> which Endless calls "totally imaginative": <a href="http://forums.insmod.org/index.php?showtopic=22458">http://forums.insmod.org/index.php?showtopic=22458</a>. Jeremy also made a post regarding Insurgency 2 based on Unreal Engine: <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?p=2424138">http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?p=2424138</a>. <br />
<br />
The problem with the attempts at takeover of Insurgency Mod by Argyll and now Jeremy <del datetime="2010-04-19T06:19:12+00:00"></del><br />
(there seems to be two major attempts, one in the past by Argyll which failed at the last minute due to Jeff Johnson AKA Jaboo224 backing out and the current one which seems to have a better chance of success and involves Jeremy)<br />
[see Argyll's comments] is that it's too little too late.<br />
<br />
I think most of the 366 members of "No confidence" steam group forgot the painful Insurgency 1.0 release that featured delays, serious bugs and a small little problem of the game crashing every 10 minutes. In short after four years of work Jeremy then Project Lead and Argyll then Project Advisor released an unplayable game unless of course you enjoyed teamkilling, micspamming and being featured in Youtube myg0t videos. If Jeremy and Argyll succeed at taking over the mod I do not want to relive the Insurgency 1.0 experience again with delays, bugs and numerous patches.<br />
<br />
What Insurgency need is a NEW vision, NEW developers, NEW project lead, NEW moderators and for fucks sake a new forum anti-spam captcha system.<br />
<br />
<b>What Insurgency does not need is incompetent past developers fighting the current incompetent developers.</b><br />
<br />
Meanwhile here's the No Confidence in Insurgency No Confidence steam community group for the lulz.<br />
