#doingitrite: Tips on Staying Anonymous <br />
<br />
<br />
Over the past month, we’ve witnessed a heap of Anons getting v&amp;, most notably sup_g, Kahuna and W0rmer.<br />
<br />
The only positive to come out of these arrests is that all Anons should learn not to be so easily socially engineered from now on.&nbsp; sup_g, Kahuna and W0rmer all contributed a lot to the cause and they will not be forgotten – but in spite of their talents, they left glaring clues to their identities all over the web. The feds didn’t catch them by using l33t whitehack skillz – the Anons effectively unmasked themselves.<br />
<br />
Anyone who’s serious about remaining anonymous should learn from these indictments to avoid making the same mistakes. It doesn’t matter how good a hacker you are – if you’re DM’ing pictures of yourself to femanons, you might as well just hand yourself in to the feds now.<br />
<br />
For future reference, these are the Anons’ fatal mistakes, as highlighted in their indictments:<br />
<br />
Kahuna allegedly:<br />
<br />
• Used ‘anonJB’ as one of his IRC names – JB are his real-life initials<br />
• Continued to operate as ‘anonJB’ after being correctly doxed in September 2011: <a href="http://pastie.org/2477266">http://pastie.org/2477266</a><br />
• Hacked websites using his work IP<br />
• Had Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and YouTube accounts in his real name. These revealed his Anon sympathies IRL, including a link to an Anonymous educational video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jborell3">http://www.youtube.com/user/jborell3</a><br />
• Retweeted Anon accounts from his own real-life Twitter (no crime, but hardly a smart move when you’re also an Anon)<br />
• Mentioned on IRC that his dad was a lawyer (the chat log was later leaked)<br />
• Accessed the @ItsKahuna Twitter account on occasions using his home IP<br />
• Tweeted news of his neighbors installing a new WEP router that he was accessing<br />
• Tweeted as @ItsKahuna to say he was fixing his friend’s computer. The IP address this tweet was posted from matched one of his Facebook friends IRL.<br />
• Fucked up and allowed details concerning his computer host to be revealed on air – he then DM’d KSL TV to ask for this incriminating evidence to be deleted from later broadcasts.<br />
• DM’d pictures of his face to @anoncutie. All of Kahuna’s tweets, DMs and IP logs were later revealed when feds subpoenaed Twitter.<br />
• Admitted in a DM to @missarahnicole the date of his 21st birthday<br />
<br />
Full indictment: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/89670544/Indictment-and-Complaint-against-Anonymous-hacker">http://www.scribd.com/doc/89670544/Indictment-and-Complaint-against-Anonymous-hacker</a><br />
<br />
<br />
W0rmer allegedly:<br />
<br />
• Posted CabinCr3w and W0rmer photos of his girlfriend’s boobs – complete with iPhone geo-data that led to her home address. <br />
• W0rmer’s girlfriend, @MissAnonFatale, revealed in a DM to @ItsKahuna that her and W0rmer would get married once he’d arranged his passport &amp; visa to Oz.<br />
• W0rmer posted a screenshot of a botnet he was running. In the background, his Skype and IRC user names are clearly visible in the applications he is running<br />
• Signed off on a forum post with the words “Higino Ochoa – AkA wOrmer” &lt;&lt; facepalm.jpg <br />
• Broke into Texas PD’s website using his neighbor’s wireless – but without trying to mask his IP<br />
• His Facebook account publicly revealed that he was in a relationship with a girl in Australia. This girl could then be linked to him via the EXIF data on the Cabin Cr3w photos and by her own Anonymous Twitter account.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
sup_g allegedly:<br />
<br />
• Used various nicknames on IRC, but allowed himself to be addressed by all these nicknames in chats with Sabu, thereby linking him to all his online personas<br />
• He regularly admitted on IRC which other nicks he used, when quizzed by others<br />
• He gave out personally identifiable info on IRC – such as admitting that he’d had activist mates who’d been arrested at a specific demonstration. sup_g’s twin brother was one of those arrested.<br />
• He also admitted on IRC that he’d been arrested at Republican National Convention in 2004, and confessed to having done time in federal prison<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
All of these Anons would still be free if they hadn’t given out so much personal information. It wasn’t failed proxy chains or Tor relays that did for them; nor was it deep packet inspection or ‘no log’ VPNs giving up logs – for the most part it was simple social engineering.<br />
<br />
At the risk of stating the obvious: if you’re doing illegal shit online, *stay* anonymous. Delete EXIF data, delete old DMs, don’t use Facebook, don’t use Twitter without masking your IP, use an anonymous nickname that can’t be tied to your real-life identity and always assume that chats are being logged and will be published.<br />
