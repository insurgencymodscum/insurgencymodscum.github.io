InterWave is behind SourceBans, HLstatsX Community Edition and the now defunct SteamFriends server. Insurgency received "Best Source Mod 2007 Gold Award" from SteamFriends.<br />
<br />
IMS2: SteamFriends back in the day was a popular server, a kind of adult alternative to EGO who were just starting out. Viper, InterWave shot caller, ended up giving admin to shitheads who through sheer incompetence and malfeasance managed to turn a once popular server into a Lord of the Flies type shithole. Viper rectified the problems by eventually shutting down SteamFriends. Insurgency was dead by then anyway.<br />
