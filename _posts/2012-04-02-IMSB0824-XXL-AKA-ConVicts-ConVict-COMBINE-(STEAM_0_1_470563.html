<blockquote>
Yes, COMBINE (STEAM_0:1:47056365 76561198054378459), the man who managed to get banned from most Insurgency communities including MurderNetworks (originally 187ci, a hacking clan) is now a XXL AKA ConVicts administrator. After getting banned from MN due to his admin friends getting banned themselves and COMBINE loosing their protection, COMBINE was allowed to grief and (recently) cheat on XXL Insurgency servers with impunity. That wasn't enough of course, and COMBINE, IMS presumes, blew a few lucky XXL members, tossed their salad, and was rewarded with admin rights.<br />
<br />
This is by far, <i>the</i> worst example of collusion and or incompetence that Insurgency Mod Scum have ever seen. IMS was perhaps too hard on certain EGO admins who willfully or unknowingly ignored or colluded with griefers and cheaters, or griefed or cheated themselves, but XXL blows that out of the water.</blockquote>
