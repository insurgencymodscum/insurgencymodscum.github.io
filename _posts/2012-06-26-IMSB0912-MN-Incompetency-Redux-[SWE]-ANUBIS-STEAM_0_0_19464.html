MN time and time again demonstrates their incompetency when it comes to policing their Insurgency server.<br />
<br />
(Also see:&nbsp;<a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/04/murdernetworks-idiocy.html">http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/2012/04/murdernetworks-idiocy.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>[SWE] ANUBIS<br />

How stupid/idiotic/retarded do you have to be to ignore blatant cheating/hacking and instead&nbsp;discriminately&nbsp;ban people for things like "shooting into/out of spawn"?&nbsp;MN wisely conceals their SourceBans admins, but [=MN=] Doctor_Eclipse&nbsp;<span style="color: #999999;">[STEAM_0:0:27632037 (76561198015529802)]</span>&nbsp; and [=MN=] HEAT <span style="color: #999999;">[STEAM_0:0:24715440 (76561198009696608)]</span> are likely responsible for this.<br />
<br />
ANUBIS is probably dying of laughter manipulating these MN admins like they are children:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>2012-07-02 09:44:53 <b>bazitch shooting from spawn</b>.<br />
2012-06-30 11:54:55 <b>stop shooting from spawn</b>.<br />
2012-06-19 12:05:04 <b>pery they are shootimg from spawn</b>.<br />
2012-06-18 12:42:50 <b>killing from spawn admin</b>.</blockquote><br />
Legit Insurgency Mod players are ending up being banned for defending their spawn usually from MN admins (or other cheater-griefers), who after getting killed attempting to exitcamp promptly ban their killer for "shooting out of spawn" (or get an MN admin to do it). This is all on ins_dust2 map by the way, with no objectives, and constant exitcamping/spawncamping.<br />
<br />
Most MN admins are friends with cheaters/hackers/griefers, MN was founded by cheaters/hackers, MN consistently recruited known cheaters/hackers/griefers, ignored complaints and evidence once cheating/hacking/griefing MN admins were exposed, and for fuck's sake, <i>still </i><a href="http://stats.murdernetworks.com/hlstats.php?mode=playerinfo&amp;player=44095">has </a><a href="http://stats.murdernetworks.com/hlstats.php?mode=playerinfo&amp;player=39440">cheaters </a>and <a href="http://stats.murdernetworks.com/hlstats.php?mode=playerinfo&amp;player=38644">griefers</a>&nbsp;administering their server.
