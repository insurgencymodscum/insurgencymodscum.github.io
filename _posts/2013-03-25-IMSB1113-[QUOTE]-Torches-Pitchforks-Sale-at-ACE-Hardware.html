<blockquote class="tr_bq">
ACE Hardware is having a spring sale on torches and pitchforks.<br />
<br />
Well, if they are on sale it's because there's no demand for them. The complacency of the population as their wealth, savings and freedom are taken from them (I won't say "stolen" because that would imply some attempt at stealth by the perpetrators) is amazing. Why the fuck aren't people outraged by all this shit?</blockquote>
