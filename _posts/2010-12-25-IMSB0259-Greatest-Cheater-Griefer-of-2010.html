Nominations for the "Greatest Griefer of 2010" and "Greatest Cheater of 2010" are now open. Place your bets ladies and gentlemen. <a href="http://insurgencymod.blogspot.com/search/label/Tom%20Chapman">Tom</a> appears to be a heavy favorite this year in both categories, but perhaps someone else could pull a surprise win?!...<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!<br />

Thank you.<br />
