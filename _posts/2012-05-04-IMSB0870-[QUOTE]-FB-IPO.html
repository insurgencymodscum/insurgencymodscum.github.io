<blockquote>It isn't Facebook that's being valued. This IPO will basically put a concrete dollar price on what having the private data of 800+ million human beings in your fist is worth. Of course the idiots who run Wall Street will value this "precious resource" at billions of dollars. That's the only thing the internet means to them: A way to track people, get at their most private data, to then mine that data to devise new ways of selling goods and services to them. It isn't Facebook that's being valued here. It's us. The IPO will put a dollar price on what the private data of 800+ million FB users is worth. Someday Facebook will face a serious downturn just like AOL and Yahoo!, and maybe disappear from the internet landscape altogether. That day can't come soon enough considering that the only thing FB trades in is other people's privacy. </blockquote><br />
