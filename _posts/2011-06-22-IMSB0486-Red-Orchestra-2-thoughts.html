<blockquote>Our current plan has PB implemented in three stages.<br />
<br />
*Stage 0: Off<br />
*Stage 1: Access to the server screenshot functionality and streaming bans<br />
*Stage 2: Standard PB protection that WILL NOT interfere with Steam (and the overlay)<br />
*Stage 3: Full PB that WILL (most likely) kick for the steam overlay<br />
<br />
Server admins can work with these to decide what anti cheat environment works best for their server. And players will be able to filter for those settings as well to find servers that fit their preferences.</blockquote><br />
IMS2:&nbsp;VAC + PunkBuster + PBBans, good&nbsp;decision&nbsp;by Tripwire. PB screenshots should police the wallhacks, aimbots are left for the players to spot. And if Tripwire fixes the broken RO spectate mode, myg0t kids are shit out of luck.<br />
<br />
The problem with RO, is the community, especially the Nazi run forums and elitism. Any mention of hacking gets immediately struck down with "there's no hackers in RO, it's too small, and VAC protects us all". RO forums moderators are bipolar Nazis. A lot of useful information and discussion is&nbsp;polluted&nbsp;by idiots and assholes who must share their opinion on every fucking thread. Bipolar Nazi forum moderators give polluters and trolls a pass due to forum seniority or RL age.<br />
<br />
But older people can be assholes too ;):<br />

P.S.&nbsp;RO uses SteamID64, instead of shorter STEAM_0: format, very annoying.
