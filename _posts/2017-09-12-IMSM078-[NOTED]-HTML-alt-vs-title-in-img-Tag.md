**TLDR: "title" attribute for tooltips, ignore the "alt" attribute**

```
The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.

The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

Tip: To create a tooltip for an image, use the title attribute!
