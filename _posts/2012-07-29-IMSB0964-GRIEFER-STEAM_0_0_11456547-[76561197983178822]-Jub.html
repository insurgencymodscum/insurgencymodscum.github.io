Reason for BAN: First I teamkilled one guy twice, both accidents - It was on Eglise, and I didn't realize that our team's spawn had moved up, so I was gunning down anyone approaching with my MG40. Both times I apologized. Soon after that, a guy named something like Poussier or something like that started teamkilling us - The people on my team can attest to that. I started teamkilling him back, and we both TK'd each other several times until I was banned.</blockquote>
