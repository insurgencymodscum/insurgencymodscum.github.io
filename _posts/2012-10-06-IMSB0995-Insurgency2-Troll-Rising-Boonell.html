Are you trying to confuse me on purpose? Romney is the savior of the United States, but you won't vote for him? <br />

I declare... you should rethink your reasons for supporting the communist. If you seriously cannot see the direction he is pushing this country in, shame on you. Not saying that Romney is the Jesus candidate, but he is for damn sure a better choice. <br />
