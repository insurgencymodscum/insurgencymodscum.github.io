FIRST PRESS RELEASE (written by Topiary)                              <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Salutations Lulz Lizards,<br />
<br />
As we're aware, the government and whitehat security terrorists across the world <br />
continue to dominate and control our Internet ocean. Sitting pretty on cargo <br />
bays full of corrupt booty, they think it's acceptable to condition and enslave <br />
all vessels in sight. Our Lulz Lizard battle fleet is now declaring immediate <br />
and unremitting war on the freedom-snatching moderators of 2011.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Operation Anti-Security (#AntiSec) - we encourage any vessel, large <br />
or small, to open fire on any government or agency that crosses their path. We <br />
fully endorse the flaunting of the word "AntiSec" on any government website <br />
defacement or physical graffiti art. We encourage you to spread the word of <br />
AntiSec far and wide, for it will be remembered. To increase efforts, we are now <br />
teaming up with the Anonymous collective and all affiliated battleships.<br />
<br />
Whether you're sailing with us or against us, whether you hold past grudges or a <br />
burning desire to sink our lone ship, we invite you to join the rebellion. <br />
Together we can defend ourselves so that our privacy is not overrun by <br />
profiteering gluttons. Your hat can be white, gray or black, your skin and race <br />
are not important. If you're aware of the corruption, expose it now, in the name <br />
of Anti-Security.<br />
<br />
Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government information, <br />
including email spools and documentation. Prime targets are banks and other <br />
high-ranking establishments. If they try to censor our progress, we will <br />
obliterate the censor with cannonfire anointed with lizard blood.<br />
<br />
It's now or never. Come aboard, we're expecting you...<br />
<br />
History begins today.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
This is the first official #antisec release<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Within this archive you will find:<br />
*) Zimbabwean government dumps<br />
*) Mosman Municipal Council (mosman.nsw.gov.au) dump<br />
*) Universal Music Group Partners dump 1 &amp; 2 containing umusic.com's user:passwords <br />
and other data<br />
*) Viacom dump containing internal mapping of Viacom and its servers<br />
*) Assorted Brazillian Government dumps and passwords<br />

CHINGA LA MIGRA COMMUNIQUE DOS *** 6/29/2011 *** HACKERS WITHOUT BORDERS<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Just when you thought it was over, we're hitting the Arizona police state with<br />
our second round of attacks. In our first bulletin we dumped a treasure trove of<br />
secret law enforcement documents. In this second bulletin, we're dumping booty<br />
pirated from a dozen Arizona police officer's personal email accounts looking<br />
specifically for humiliating dirt. This leak has names, addresses, phone<br />
numbers, passwords, social security numbers, online dating account info,<br />
voicemails, chat logs, and seductive girlfriend pictures belonging to a dozen<br />
Arizona police officers. We found more internal police reports, cops forwarding<br />
racist chain emails, k9 drug unit cops who use percocets, and a convicted sex<br />
offender who was part of FOP Maricopa Lodge Five. <br />

CHINGA LA MIGRA COMMUNIQUE 3 ** 7/01/2011 ** FRATERNAL OWNAGE OF POLICE<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
For the third knockout blow against Arizona law enforcement, we decided to get <br />
destructive. We're defacing eight AZ Fraternal Order of Police websites and <br />
releasing a master list of over 1200 officer's usernames, passwords, and email <br />
addresses. Additionally we are leaking hundreds of private FOP documents and <br />
several more mail spools belonging to FOP presidents, vice presidents, <br />
secretaries, a police chief, and the FOP Labor Council executive directory and <br />
webmaster whose insecure web development skills was responsible for this whole <br />
mess. We're doing this not only because we are opposed to SB1070 and the racist <br />
Arizona police state, but because we want a world free from police, prisons and <br />
politicians altogether.<br />

Turkish Takedown Thursday -- Hailing to our brothers Team Redhack<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Our vessel recently encountered a Turkish Government frigate, a chance we <br />
could not not let pass. So we simply boarded their vessel (no need to fire<br />
any cannons, mind you, they never found out what happened until just now).<br />
and collected some booty. Find the dump of some 100 plus .tr domains in <br />
this release. For a good measure we also decided to remove 74 Turkish <br />
government websites and replace the content with a better message.<br />

Fuck FBI Friday II: IRCFederal<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
We released the ownage of another government-contracted IT company, IRC<br />
Federal. They brag about their multi-million dollar partnership with the FBI,<br />
Army, Navy, NASA, and the Department of Justice, selling out their "skills" to<br />
the US empire. So we laid nuclear waste to their systems, owning their pathetic<br />
windows box, dropping their databases and private emails, and defaced their<br />
professional looking website.<br />

Military Meltdown Monday: Mangling Booz Allen Hamilton<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
We wanted to turn our attention to Booz Allen Hamilton, whose core business <br />
is contractual work completed on behalf of the US federal government, foremost <br />
on defense and homeland security matters, and limited engagements of foreign <br />
governments specific to U.S. military assistance programs.<br />

FUCK FBI FRIDAY III: ManTech Mayhem<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
We followed the tradition of humiliating our friends <br />
from the FBI once again. This time we hit one of their biggest contractors for <br />
cyber security: Mantech International Corporation.<br />

Shooting Sherriffs Saturday<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A week after we defaced and destroyed the websites of over 70 law enforcement<br />
agencies, we are releasing a massive amount of confidential information that is<br />
sure to embarass, discredit and incriminate police officers across the US. Over<br />
10GB of information was leaked including hundreds of private email spools,<br />
password information, address and social security numbers, credit card numbers,<br />
snitch information, training files, and more. We hope that not only will<br />
dropping this info demonstrate the inherently corrupt nature of law enforcement<br />
using their own words, as well as result in possibly humiliation, firings, and<br />
possible charges against several officers, but that it will also disrupt and<br />
sabotage their ability to communicate and terrorize communities.<br />

ANTISEC LEAKS "OPERATION SATIAGRAHA" EVIDENCE EXPOSING HIGH-LEVEL CORRUPTION<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
On the same day that dozens of Brazilian government officials were arrested on<br />
corruption charges, and the communications ministry proposing to ban independent<br />
internet access providers, we are releasing a cache of evidence revealing<br />
government coverup of a corruption investigation involving the CIA, the<br />
Brazilian telecom industry, and multiple US corporations.<br />

Fuck FBI Friday IV: Vanguard Defense Industries<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
For #FuckFBIFriday, we released 1GB of private emails and documents<br />
belonging to Vanguard Defense Industries(VDI), a defense contractor that sells<br />
arms to law enforcement, military, and private corporations. The emails belong<br />
to Senior Vice President of VDI Richard T. Garcia, who has previously worked as<br />
Assistant Director to the Los Angeles FBI office as well as the Global Security<br />
Manager for Shell Oil Corporation. This leak contains internal meeting notes and<br />
contracts, schematics, non-disclosure agreements, personal information about<br />
other VDI employees, and several dozen "counter-terrorism" documents classified<br />
as "law enforcement sensitive" and "for official use only".<br />

Texas Takedown Thursday: Chinga La Migra IV<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Lewd jokes? Check. Racist chain mails? Check. You lost your radio license? Lulz.<br />
Playing on the fears of voters? Check. But we already figured that. Our friends,<br />
allies, and vessels are threatened with 10+ years in prison. Yet terrorists like<br />
Luis Posada Carilles go free. This hypocritical and paranoid reaction puts us<br />
and the citizens you are supposed to protect in the same boat. You call us a<br />
national security risk. Yet BATFE guns go directly to drug dealers so they can<br />
take out rivals who don't launder money through backrooms of dominant banks. Any<br />
press can check court documents from operations like 'Fast and Furious'. Who<br />
came up with that one? What you didn't see 'From Dusk 'til Dawn'? Better title.<br />
Be more creative next time.<br />

Fuck FBI Friday V: IACIS Cybercrime Investigators Owned<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
As part of our ongoing effort to expose and humiliate our white hat enemies, we<br />
targeted a Special Agent Supervisor of the CA Department of Justice in charge of<br />
computer crime investigations. We are leaking over 38,000 private emails which<br />
contain detailed computer forensics techniques, investigation protocols as well<br />
as highly embarrassing personal information. We are confident these gifts will <br />
bring smiles to the faces of our black hat brothers and sisters (especially <br />
those who have been targeted by these scurvy dogs) while also making a mockery <br />
of "security professionals" who whore their "skills" to law enforcement to <br />
protect tyrannical corporativism and the status quo we aim to destroy.<br />

Fuck FBI Friday VI PUCKETT &amp; FARAJ 3GB Data Leak<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In January, Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich faced a US military court martial in <br />
connection with the bloody massacre of 24 Iraqi men, women and children in the <br />
town of Haditha.<br />
<br />
Wuterich, 31, admitted in open court to one count of negligent dereliction of <br />
duty. Manslaughter charges were dropped as part of a plea deal from the <br />
prosecution.<br />
<br />
Wuterich admitted to leading an eight-man squad of US Marines—whose other <br />
members have all been let off—in 2005 when they killed 24 civilians in Iraq. In <br />
a military court, Wuterich was sentenced to a mere 90 days of confinement, but <br />
under the terms of the plea bargain, he will serve no time in jail for his <br />
misdeeds. He was also demoted in rank to Private. <br />
<br />
Because the wheels of justice failed to exact a proper outcome in this tragic <br />
case, on 3 February 2012, Anonymous sought street justice by destroying the <br />
website of Neal Puckett and Haytham Faraj, the attorneys who defended Wuterich <br />
in during his tribunal. Anonymous went further by publishing three gigabytes of <br />
private email messages obtained directly from both attorneys’ personal email <br />
accounts. <br />

All conflict comes from social inequality and those who use this to their <br />
advantage. Our civilization is facing a radical, imminent mass change. The <br />
alternative to the hierarchical power structure is based on mutual aid and group <br />
consensus. As hackers we can learn these systems, manipulate these systems, and <br />
shut down these systems if we need to.<br />

The IACP thought they could hold their 2011 annual conference in Chicago<br />
unfettered by the clutches of insurrection. They must not have known their<br />
conference starts on the Day of Action Against Police Brutality. They must not<br />
have known that all over the world people are in the streets demonstrating<br />
discontent with capitalism and the state. They also had no idea that for the<br />
past few months black hat hackers have been owning their websites and databases.<br />
They should have expected us.<br />
