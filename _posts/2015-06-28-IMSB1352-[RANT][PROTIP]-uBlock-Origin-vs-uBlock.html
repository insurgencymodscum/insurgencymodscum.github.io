<br />
TLDR: use uBlock Origin<br />
<br />
If you gonna fork something, pick a new fucking name. This whole renaming shit only causes confusion.<br />
<br />
If you need to make a decision which Chrome ad blocking extensions to use compare the two programmers:<br />
<br />
Raymond Hill AKA "gorhill", "uBlock Origin", original uBlock<br />
<a href="https://github.com/gorhill?tab=repositories">https://github.com/gorhill?tab=repositories</a><br />
<br />
Chris Aljoudi, new uBlock<br />
<a href="https://github.com/chrisaljoudi?tab=repositories">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi?tab=repositories</a><br />
<br />
Clearly gorhill has more applicable programming experience compared to Chris (who doesn't even have a cool name :) )<br />
<br />
Bonus: Aljoudi's website (<a href="https://chrismatic.io/">https://chrismatic.io/</a>) has the hipster-brogrammer-brosigner feel. Gorhill's website (<a href="http://www.raymondhill.net/">http://www.raymondhill.net/</a>) doesn't even work (at least on my computer). A broken website is better than a working hipster-brogrammer-brosigner website IMHO.<br />
