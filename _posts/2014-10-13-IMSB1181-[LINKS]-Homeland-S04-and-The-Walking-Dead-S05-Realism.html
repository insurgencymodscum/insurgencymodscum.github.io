There is <i>NO </i>good show on TV right now. Homeland and The Walking Dead are certainly not Breaking Bad or The Wire. Not even close. <br />

Homeland S04: An Intelligence "Expert" Weighs In <br />
<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/tag/homeland/">http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/tag/homeland/</a><br />
<br />
INSMODSCUM is not an intelligence expert, but let's see:<br />
<br />
You are CIA in Pakistan. Go ahead and ride in an armored car so you won't get murdered by an angry Paki mob! The stupidity (and production values) of this show hit a new low. Homeland seems to double down on product placement though. Perhaps, a product placement drinking game is needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Walking Dead, did not bother hiring a technical consultant <i>again</i> this season. INSMODSCUM got seriously drunk, taking a shot with every tactical or weapon related stupidity in E01. There were a lot.<br />
<br />
This season TWD and Homeland are only good for getting drunk, and getting angry.
