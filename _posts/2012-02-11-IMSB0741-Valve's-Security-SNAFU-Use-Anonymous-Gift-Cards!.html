<blockquote>Dear Steam Users and Steam Forum Users<br />
<br />
We continue our investigation of last year's intrusion with the help of outside security experts. In my last note about this, I described how intruders had accessed our Steam database but we found no evidence that the intruders took information from that database. That is still the case.<br />
<br />
Recently we learned that it is probable that the intruders obtained a copy of a backup file with information about Steam transactions between 2004 and 2008. This backup file contained user <b>names</b>, <b>email addresses</b>, encrypted <b>billing addresses</b>&nbsp;and encrypted <b>credit card information [<i>IMS: and very likely phone numbers</i>]</b>. It did not include Steam passwords [<i><b>IMS:&nbsp;shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...</b></i>].<br />
<br />
We do not have any evidence that the encrypted credit card numbers or billing addresses have been compromised. However as I said in November it's a good idea to watch your credit card activity and statements. And of course keeping Steam Guard on is a good idea as well.<br />
<br />
We are still investigating and working with law enforcement authorities. Some state laws require a more formal notice of this incident so some of you will get that notice, but we wanted to update everyone with this new information now.<br />
<br />

My name, email address, billing address and credit card information are compromised, but not my Steam password.&nbsp;Thanks Gabe. If you gonna encrypt billing addresses and credit card information, why not encrypt names and email addresses?<br />
<br />
Insurgency Mod Scum Pro Tip: use prepaid Visa or Mastercard gift cards instead of PayPal and CCs.<br />
