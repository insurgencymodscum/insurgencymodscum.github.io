Upon first firing up my new 1700 build, I was not overly impressed. After all, there has been a lot of hype. It was faster than my 8370 oc'd to 4.8, sure, but I didn't honestly see what all the hype was about...at first. I am still waiting for Cryorig, the company that makes my AIO liquid cooler, to send my an AM4 bracket, so I am using the stock wraith cooler for now. But even with the stock cooler, I was easily able to get a stable 3.8 with a slight voltage increase.

And it was once I overclocked this little chip that I saw what the hype was about. Fast, smooth, and amazing! AMD's vision that multi-threaded performance would be the future may have been too ahead of it's time when the Piledriver architecture came out, but that vision is right on the mark now. I can't even imagine what I will be able to achieve with liquid cooling.

It is great for CPU intensive gaming, and with my FressSync enabled monitor and RX 570x, it is silky smooth, but I use it primarily for music production. I use Presonus Studio One 3 Pro, and it eats up multiple digital tracks with reverb, amp modding, multiple MIDI inputs, Izotope, Melodyne, you name it, with ease.

This has also opened up the opportunity for me to start exploring software I never would have considered, like Blender, writing scripts again, etc. I feel like I'm back in the computer world again!

And as a side note, I just want to give my 2 cents about how tired I am of these people on YouTube presenting themselves as experts but in reality doing little more with their computer than playing Grand Theft Auto 5 or rendering videos about themselves playing Grand Theft Auto 5. Computers can do SO MUCH MORE! And this processor, overclocked, opens up that world. So for anyone who is still advocating spending a crazy amount of money on Intel, I just sincerely want to know what, say...an I7 5960x can do that this can't (except cost $750 dollars more and play a game where you beat up people and steal their cars faster).

Thank you AMD, for giving an honest working man like me an exceptionally powerful processor that I can afford!
