There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use.

Harry J. Anslinger<br />
<br />
Mr. Anslinger was named Director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics when it was formed in 1931 as part of the Treasury Department. Many people believe that he collaborated with industry giants to outlaw mj. It is known that Mr. Anslinger was aquainted with both the Hearsts (of Hearst Newspapers), and the DuPonts, of DuPont plastic fame.<br />
<br />
In the 1930s, Hearst, who owned newspapers (and timber) all over the country, started publishing sensationalist-type "news" stories about marijuana use. These stories, often written by Hearst or Anslinger himself, talked about the "insanity, criminality, and death" caused by smoking marijuana, sometimes after just one joint. This intense propaganda campaign led to a public outcry for anti-mj laws in many states. The Federal Government was only too happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
In 1937, DuPont had just patented a process to make plastics from oil and coal, as well as a new bleaching process for making paper from wood pulp.<br />
<br />
Also in 1937, the Marijuana Tax Stamp Act was passed, effectively prohibiting possession or use of marijuana. It was claimed to be needed to oversee and coordinate existing state law concerning mj.<br />
<br />
These are excerpts of Mr. Anslinger's testimony before a Senate Hearing on marijuana in 1937.<br />
<br />
"There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."<br />
<br />
"... the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races."<br />
<br />
"Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death."<br />
<br />
"You smoke a joint and you're likely to kill your brother."<br />
<br />
"marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind."</blockquote>
