<i>Just spitballing here, it's not all going to be gold.</i><br />
<br />
If a player caps all the objectives, and kills the entire opposing team, then...<br />
<br />
<b>If Insurgent</b>: player gets a dirty nuclear bomb and detonates it, that will turn the entire team into zombies that are only able to be killed with a headshot. Security Forces get bolt-action rifles.<br />
<br />
<b>If Security Forces</b>: player calls in a nuclear strike. Every player than sees the player who called in the nuke riding atop the bomb into destruction just like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/">Dr Strangelove</a>. "AllTalk" is on and everybody else is muted, so the "hero" can say whatever he wants as he is riding down.<br />
<br />
P.S. On hardcore mode, Security Forces players either get one clip, or one bolt-action rifle. Insurgent zombies get RPGs.
