From Cwivey:<br />
<br />
I thought I'd create a little sound mod for RO2 to increase some of the sounds' impact. <br />
<br />
Read more below. <br />
<br />
Disclaimers:<br />
The sounds in this mod have not been as extensivly tested as I hoped to have done, some may not apear to work as intended.<br />
Some sounds may still be over-shadowed by others.<br />
There will be issues with joining multiplayer games after playing singleplayer (Relating to missmatched files), joining a multiplayer game straight off works however.<br />
Having an understanding of what you're doing to the files in folders and how to restore them if all goes bottoms up will help greatly. (I will explain it, but if you can do it yourself all the better)<br />
I would suggest only using it on the Vanilla RO2, the changes to the Beta may address some of these already, that and it may not work with the Beta anyways. <br />
What it does:<br />
Increase in volume of artillery strikes and artillery whiz-by sounds.<br />
Increase the volume of Grenades and Satchels.<br />
A very slight increase to the expendeture sound of the German smoke grenades.<br />
Increase in tank main weapon firing volume.<br />
Increase in volume of bullet impacts near the player.<br />
Increase in volume of bullet whiz-by's.<br />
Bullet snaps now happen 100% of the time in near-misses compared to the 0.33333 chance found in-game currently.<br />
Installation:<br />
<br />
Extract the files within the Zipped folder to...<br />
C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/red orchestra 2/ROGame/CookedPC/Packages/Audio<br />
<br />
Allow it to over-write the files. And that's it!<br />
<br />
Reverting back to the old sounds...<br />
<br />
If, for any reason, you want to revert back to the sounds as they were origonally, follow these next steps in doing so:<br />
<br />
Go to the folder C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/red orchestra 2/ROGame/CookedPC/Packages/Audio<br />
<br />
Find and delete the files;<br />
AUD_EXP_Artillery.upk<br />
AUD_EXP_Grenade_F1.upk<br />
AUD_EXP_SatchelCharge.upk<br />
AUD_EXP_SmokeNade_German.upk<br />
AUD_EXP_Tanks.upk<br />
AUD_Firearms.upk<br />
AUD_Impacts.upk<br />
AUD_Projectiles.upk<br />
AUD_Vehicle_Tank_PanzerIV.upk<br />
AUD_Vehicle_Tank_T34.upk<br />
Then, go to steam, right click on Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, click Properties.<br />
Click on the "LOCAL FILES" tab.<br />
Click "VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE..."<br />
Let it work through and re-download the files (Shouldn't take more than around five minutes, depending on your internet connection)<br />
Done and done. The sounds should be as they were and any bugs encountered will be purley the games fault. :cool:<br />
