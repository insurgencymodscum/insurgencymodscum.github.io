<blockquote>How to join spectator mode to demo hackers?<br />
<br />
Good day,<br />
<br />
I recently started playing on your Dust2 Insurgency server. I'm a long time Counter Strike Source player (since it's release, and played a couple years of CS 1.5 (never upgraded to 1.6 because I didn't want to be forced to use Steam)). A couple years ago I stopped playing CSS and started playing Alliance Of Valiant Arms. I enjoy the game since you rarely come across anyone cheating (in game report function that takes screenshots of the suspects game, gets all wallhackers banned). But I got annoyed by so many severe laggers (causing you to get killed after taking cover behind a wall).<br />
<br />
Anyways, I found out about the Insurgency source mod recently and tried it out. Turns out it is a really fun game. The first day I was getting owned, mainly because I had to slow down my play style (1 or 2 bullets usually kill you in this game). Now I've got it, I do very well when not playing against cheaters.<br />
<br />
There are definitely some good players in here, but also some hackers. TL:DR Here is my list of confirmed hackers, so far:<br />
"ben laden" STEAM_0:1:45737007<br />
"Tkgun" STEAM_0:1:30199101<br />
"Boogie Man" STEAM_0:0:25136089<br />
"WOOFER" STEAM_0:0:46050206<br />
<br />
All four of these players have prefired me, shot me through doors without seeing me, many many times. All four are clearly wallhackers. <br />
<br />
I know they won't be banned without proof, and that is my question. Forgive me I'm new to this game, and it isn't the same as CSS, how do I join spectator mode in Insurgency so I can demo them?</blockquote>
