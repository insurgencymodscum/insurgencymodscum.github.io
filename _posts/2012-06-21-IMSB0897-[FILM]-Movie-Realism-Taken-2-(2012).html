This guy is so gonna fuck up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397280/board/">this movie</a>.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
[Olivier] Megaton takes his name from his birthday : the 6th of August 1965 is the 20th anniversary of the dropping of the Hiroshima A-bomb</blockquote>
<br />
IMDB says he's known for Colombiana (2011), mindless drivel, and Transporter 3 (2008), a shitty remake.<br />
<br />
Hollywood shotcallers should have stuck with the original Taken director or maybe gotten somebody good, that list is very, very small. Maybe <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002191/">this guy</a>.
