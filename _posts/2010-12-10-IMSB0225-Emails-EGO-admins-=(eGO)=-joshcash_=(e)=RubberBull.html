<blockquote>"Feel free to post this if you want.&nbsp; This is regarding behavior of some senior EGO members and how they handle bans, which is relevant to this blog since there are so many EGO bans listed. <br />
<br />
If you look at EGO you would think because of their size and structure they are a little more professional than other smaller clans.... But no, EGO is just like everybody else or in this case ever worse. EGO bans should not be trusted blindly [<b><i>IMS: agreed</i></b>].<br />
<br />
Here's how the ban/appeal process works at EGO. <br />
<br />
The ban process:<br />
EGO, EG and E members break their own rules, for example publicly accusing another player of cheating.<br />
EGO, EG, and E members ignore other players breaking the above mentioned rule.<br />
A particular EGO member <b>covertly </b>[<b><i>IMS: emphasis added by sender</i></b>] records a demo. <br />
A particular EGO member breaks other EGO rules, e.g. teamkilling<br />
I'm assuming the same EGO member lies, exaggerates, conspires with others and bans a good player with little or no proof [and] with a phony reason/excuse.<br />
<br />
The appeal process:<br />
The wrongly banned player is banned from EGO forums to prevent ban appeal submission.<br />
<br />
That is why EGO is worse than other clans in this case. At least other clans would let you appeal your ban, pretend to seriously consider the appeal and of course deny it. But not EGO:<br />
"COMPLAINING ABOUT Ego MEMBERS FOR OVER A YEAR IS STEAM BANNED CONTACT [<b>redacted</b>] BEFORE UNBANNING."<br />
"go noy unban without talking to [<b>redacted</b>] first" [<b><i>IMS: go, no unban without talking to [redacted] first?</i></b>]<br />
<br />
Here are the bad EGO admins IMHO [<b><i>IMS: added links, STEAMIDs and other info</i></b>]:<br />

And for completeness:<br />
=(e)=RubberBullet, currently not a bad admin due to lack of admin rights, but an inevetable failure once he gets promoted<br />

Look at EGO bans with a grain of salt, since you can't even contest them.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<blockquote>He got permanent banned from all of eGO servers including all accounts on the eGO site.<br />
He got banned for 'GRIEFING', lol. <br />
"QQ [<b>redacted</b>]". We won't miss you.<br />
<br />
P.S. Today I also heard many people say (especially Marines): "Finally this piece of shit '[<b>redacted</b>]' is gone. OOHRA!"</blockquote><br />
