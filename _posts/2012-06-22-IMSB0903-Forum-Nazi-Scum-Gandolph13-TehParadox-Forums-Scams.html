<blockquote>TehParadox, from my experience, has probably the worst administrators and moderators of any forum. Everything is monetized. Users are usually not banned but are sentenced to "miserable users" which just redirects to a netload referral page, making TehParadox owners a nice profit even from banished users. Less often forum accounts and ALL posts are deleted and "disappeared". <br />
<br />
Between asking for donations, and obtrusive ads, TehParadox owners probably have a nice income, coming entirely from their users' work, who are repaid by being consistently shit on.<br />

Hey MORON<br />
I'm not from the US, and the site is a free site which relies on donations for server costs.<br />
If you were banned, probably by me, you obviously didn't follow the rules, treated members like crap, like you refer to us here, spammed the forums or were just an A hole in general.<br />
<br />
All staff are voluntary, we don't get paid or kick backs and offer our services to keep brain dead scum like you from ruining the place<br />
<br />
Grow up!<br />
