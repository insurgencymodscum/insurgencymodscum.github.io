We call it cutting
It isn't exactly that
To me it goes much deeper
Cutting implies separating something
It really should be called assembling
Mosaic is assembling something to create a home
To create an idea

No Shortcuts

"No Shortcuts"

Lyrics from:

`The Secret to Success The Secret to Success by Eric Thomas`

```
I thought you said you want to be successful
He said I'd do
He said when you want to succeed
As bad you want to breath
Then you'll be successful

???
The only thing you're trying to do is to get some air
You don't care no more about basketball game
You don't care what's on TV
You don't care about nobody callin' you
You don't care about a party
The only thing you care about when you try to breath
Is to get some fresh air
That's it
And when you get to the point
Where all you wanna do is be successful
As bad as you wanna breath
Then you'll be successful

And I'm here to tell you number one
That most of you say you wanna be successful but you don't want it bad
You just kinda want it
You don't want it bad as you wanna party
You don't want it as much as you wanna be cool
Most of you don't want success as much as you want to sleep!
Some of you love sleep more than you love success
And I'm here to tell you today
If you're goin' to be successful you gotta be willin' to give up sleep!
