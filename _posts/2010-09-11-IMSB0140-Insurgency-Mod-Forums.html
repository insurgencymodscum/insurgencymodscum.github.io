Jun 2008 - present day (and future)<br />
More of the same. Insurgency 2.5 release. More crashes. Drama between <a href="http://insurgencymod.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/confidence/">Argyll/Inslegacy</a>, Jeremy, <a href="http://insurgencymod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/endless-incompetence/">Endless</a> and Spielmann. <a href="http://insurgencymod.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/revolt-mod-insurgency-death/">Insurgency Mod Development death</a>. <a href="http://insurgencymod.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/insurgency-2-the-art-of-revolution-insaor-insurgency-classic/">Insurgency 2/Insurgency Classic </a>. And the inevitable  Insmod.org Forums death.
