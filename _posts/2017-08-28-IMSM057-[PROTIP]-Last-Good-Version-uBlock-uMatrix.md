"Gorhill" is an asshole if you didn't know.

# Last Good Version: uBlock #

FireFox: `1.10.6`
Chrome/Chromium: `1.10.4`

Note: `1.11.0` and later dumb down the UI too much (can't see URLs in the input box in "3rd-party filters" section)

Changing UI is a sign of rot!

# Last Good Version: uMatrix #

`0.9.3.6`

Note: `1.0` and later simplifies (dumbs down) the UI for no reason.
