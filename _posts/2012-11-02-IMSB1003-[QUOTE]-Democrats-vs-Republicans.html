<blockquote class="tr_bq">
From my standpoint, both the DNC and the RNC are a bunch of posturing hypocritical leeches on society who don't give a shit about anything but gaining power, money and control. Their only real difference is in how they each want these things exerted, and on whom, but their goals are the same so long as they are the ones in charge when the dust settles.<br />
<br />
Ideology? Pfft! That's simply the truncheon they use to keep their respective troops in line.<br />
<br />
A pox on both your frickin' houses. </blockquote>
