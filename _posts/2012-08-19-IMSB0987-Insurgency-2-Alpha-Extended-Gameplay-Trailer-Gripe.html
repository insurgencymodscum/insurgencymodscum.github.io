<ul><li>Rename YT video, perhaps "Insurgency 2 Alpha Extended Gameplay"?</li>
<li>Kill notifications are good, actually helps catch cheaters.</li>
<li>Regarding the timer. I wouldn't display milliseconds maybe until there's a couple minutes left.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Regarding EKG in the left corner of the screen. I really don't give a fuck about my heart health. In addition zero fucks are given regarding the current team or the current class. The EKG graph is useless.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Regarding munition counters, I wish New World Interactive went with Red Orchestra 2 design. You get "this magazine is heavy or light", and your remaining munitions when you either reload or press a "situational awareness" key.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Round counter is just lame. Personally I would question calling my game "Insurgency 2" and showing off such a COD (read: bad) feature in a promenent way (perhaps not even COD, COD lately has been moving from arcade towards realism).</li>
</ul>Previous IMS1 and IMS2 gripes regarding lasers, WWII weapons and tracers still apply.<br />
<br />
BTW towards the end of the video (7:30), a rifle ressembling MN with a jerry-rigged scope is used. This is blasphemy for any Red Orchestra veteran.<br />
<br />
It seems New World Interactive went the same was as Tripwire Interactive - try to get a bigger player base by adding arcade features. I just hope everything works out and Insurgency 2 ends up not being a COD clone on the Source Engine.<br />
<br />
Remember, you gotta stay clear of all the noobs.
