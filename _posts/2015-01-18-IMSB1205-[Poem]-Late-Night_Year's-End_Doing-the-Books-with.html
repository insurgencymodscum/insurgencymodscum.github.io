<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Late Night, Year's End,<br />
Doing the Books with Du Fu<br />
<br />
Ghost fires in the jade palace. Moonlight<br />
a scattering of opals on the river. Over us<br />
beasts of the zodiac march across the night.<br />
We drink cup after cup of warm rice wine.<br />
It's time to take out the ledger, to figure<br />
the year's accounts. Du Fu, if our days <br />
and nights are the principal, if all the years <br />
are interest, then how much do we owe?<br />
If I subtract my grief from joy, what is left?<br />
Tell me, old friend, how does it balance?<br />
In one of your last poems you talk about<br />
the stars outside your hut, how impossible <br />
to count them. There are no numbers,<br />
you say, for this life. Who cares if we're<br />
in the red? Or the black? Add a few zeros,<br />
and we're rich. Erase a few, and we're poor.<br />
You're right, Du Fu. Rich or poor, the night<br />
each night burgeons within us. The mornings<br />
open with sunlight, Why count them?<br />
Instead of numbers, let me enter words<br />
into the ledger, this account of our friendship,<br />
this little poem from me to you, across<br />
the glimmering, innumerable years.</blockquote>
