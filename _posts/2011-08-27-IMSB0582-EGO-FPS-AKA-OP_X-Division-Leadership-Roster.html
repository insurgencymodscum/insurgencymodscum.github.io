Note: Admin Trainers are not official members of leadership. They do however, do important things for the division.<br />
<br />
Advisors are the Front-Line of Leadership, as such, they should be your first point of contact on all matters.<br />

Division Leaders are the highest level of leadership at the Division Level. You should ALWAYS contact an Advisor before you contact a Division Leader or Council<br />

Council is the first level of leadership that controls all divisions. Council is responsible for important decisions, and other clan-wide business. In Most cases, issues are resolved at the Advisor or Division Leader level. So you should only contact a council member with a problem if absolutely necessary.<br />
