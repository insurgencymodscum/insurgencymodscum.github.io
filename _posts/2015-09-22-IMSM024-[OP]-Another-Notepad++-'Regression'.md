Due to a critical regression, Notepad++ 6.8.9 release has been removed from the website.

The regression is a crash issue : while user switches off from Notepad++ and an opened document is modified outside, user switches back to Notepad++ and answer YES for reloading the modified document - then the crash happens.

The new release 6.8.10 to fix this regression will be available soon. In the meantime, please downgrade to v6.8.8.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yet another Notepad++ "regression". This is the second one IMS has lived through. If you love losing your data and beta testing text editors, then Notepad++ is for you! Update away!

<br>

Quitting Notepad++ is hard, but you have to do it.
